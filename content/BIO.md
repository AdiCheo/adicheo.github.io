**Adrian — Builder of systems, seeker of synchronicities.**

I weave code, myth, and automation into frameworks that help people reclaim their time, attention, and soul. Over the last 5 years, I’ve worked across sectors—healthcare, finance, telecom, small business—using Python, Make, n8n, and AI to untangle the mess of modern operations. I build tools that think with you: AI-assisted calendars, auto-generated knowledge bases, agentic workflows, and other strange beasts that make work feel less like war.

  

I’m the mind behind _Outlaw Intelligence_, a creative tech agency and a philosophy. We blend automation with integrity, helping humans escape the machine without rejecting it. Whether it’s building ERP-style systems for life tracking, making Balkan synth-folk about UTIs, or visualizing dream-state meditations with surreal AI animation, the core is the same: find the signal in the chaos and make something honest from it.

  

I speak code and metaphor. I prototype quickly. I ask good questions.

Let’s build something that matters—or at least makes you laugh, cry, or breathe deeper.
