I want to build a one page vanilla html,js,css with tailwind and connection to supabase. 
It will have a simple email auth flow (no password) that leads to the skills page (dashboard).

The Skills page will have a professional game RPG old-school aesthetic, think the skills menu from Runescape / Elder scrolls. The aesthetic will be a mix between pixelated arcade, and fantasy. 

The skill hierarchy section will follow traditional pedagogical concepts (trivium and quadrivium) branching into DSL for applications in example Design, software, engineering, communications, law, art, business, economics, include movement (dance, martial arts, athleticism, fitness, surfing, skating, skydiving) and health meter (eating/sleeping/habits) and survival skills like fishing, climbing, safety, firestarting, camping, travelling, negotiating.

Each skill will be evaluated as a number 1-99 (filters to show only skills over a certain level, or by name) 

A section will show ranking of the user by local, regional, or world ranking and invite competitions and sharing.

A logbook section will show activities (name, details, date, location) and xp gained to which skills. Some activities can affect multiple skills.
