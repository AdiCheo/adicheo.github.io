<p>This year is off to an explosive start... From seeing my life flash before my eyes when a firework backfired into a propane tank on NYE to the humbleness of my second time adjusting to the mexican food (read: ü§Æüí©) I've been starkly reminded not to take health and life for granted. <br>I'm experiencing new places, new friends, and a lot of learning.</p><p><br>The vulnerability of being a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/nomad/">#nomad</a> means i don't have the option to resist practicing a new language, and trusting people I've just met for a short time.<br><br>This kind of change makes me feel somehow transparent - like my past knowledge just dissolved into a new existence.<br><br>My mission is to grow my qualities and progress in my abilities to be helpful to others (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/generosity/">#generosity</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/virtue/">#virtue</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/renunciation/">#renunciation</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/wisdom/">#wisdom</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/work/">#work</a>-ethic, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/patience/">#patience</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/truthfulness/">#truthfulness</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/determination/">#determination</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/compassionate/">#compassionate</a>-love, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/equanimity/">#equanimity</a>)<br><br>______<br><br>Before making this post I initially wanted to do the kind of influencer-style post with some of the great experiences of the last few days<br><br>sunset beaches, hammocks, festivals, dancing, designer cocktails, extravagant plates of food... to encourage and remind my friends to join me on my travels and to create a FOMO that might inspire some to be more intentional with their lives.<br><br>What is becoming clearer to me is that although I can appreciate all of those wonders - they are not for sharing... I don't need more busyness.<br><br>Luxuries of beautiful landscapes and indulgent food are quite distracting in reality, sadly, so is meeting transient people.<br><br>We celebrate these things because in the constant discomfort of being nomadic these pleasures are the ones that others tend to point out as our blessings, the things they most envy.<br><br>It's good marketing &amp; bad in practice.<br><br>So I came up with this picture... I'm happy, I'm challenged, I'm inspired to practice my meditation and develop my internal peace.<br><br>I'm reminded that no material luxury is sweeter than overflowing with compassion and love from inside.<br><br>This is what I really want to share.<br><br>Palm trees not required to enjoy.<br><br>Take time to go slow.<br><br>Look inside to develop your qualities.<br><br>Look outside to help others.<br><br>May you be happy.<br><br>May all beings be happy ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
