<p>Posted a video around my intention to coach others into freedom.</p>

</figure><p>Talking starts at <a href="https://youtu.be/bV-LtAxDBvM?t=29">29s</a></p><p>Reach out to have this conversation about freedom. </p><p>What does being content with enough mean to you? </p><p>This video was inspired by someone reaching out to ask me to be a coach for their transition to living wild in a beach town. </p><p>These are times when the oppressive powers of increasingly totalitarian institutions are trying to control our behaviour, expression, and ability to think. I found my freedom in this time, my inspiration to live well and share more with those around me. Iâ€™m thankful for the wake-up call. </p><p>May all be happy.</p>
