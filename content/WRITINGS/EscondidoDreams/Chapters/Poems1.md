I
Newspeak is Here
I woke up in a prison this morning. I was in a room with a
comfy bed and a laptop. I had food, internet access, and
coffee. Even my girlfriend had been over for some time. The
weather was great, and the sunshine through my window
kept my room warm most of the day.
I slept in and was well rested. I got a few calls from friends
today, drank coffee, and watched some videos/podcasts. I
meditated, I read, I took a cold bath.
It was a good day - I had felt a spark. It was this feeling as
if I had some control. As if I could do what I wanted. I tried to
hold onto it but it slipped away. I tried saying something
about it but I couldn't make a sound. I wanted to hear myself
say something about it - but I'm not sure there as anything to
be said.
What have you said lately? To who? Who was listening?
Who heard?
I woke up…

Dot dot dot
Dots and dots.
i write for the dots.
the counters of my success.
i write for the dots.
i love the dots.
go dots.
godots…
godot.
God’s dots.
the story is about me.
i might rant it out all at once and then say nothing at all
forever.
to you it’s all funny and you probably heard it all before
even the secrets i can only wink at in the writing
but you can hear it all again
and probably think
yeah this guy is crazy
fucking glad i met him
and i’m fucking glad i met you too
you gave me a chance to put it all out
pull it out and swing it around
sometimes slam it on a table
or dive with it into a pool
or dance on a table
or let you make it pulse and disappear
14
it all happened and continues to happen
all the time and for all time
i’m a sexual being among other shortcomings
and i’m an open book
i always was…
so I should say sorry if you expected that i wouldn’t tell our
story
what can i say…
i’m happy you weren’t so sure i’d write that you avoided me
all together.
and i’d be happier if you don’t run away when you recognize
our chapter…
remember we have been together since the beginning
we never get to be apart
the laws of this reality are as they are
and we continue
swirling around through it

puerto boy reflections
I’m a puerto boy
a puerto vortex boy
I’m here to find myself
I’m here to upgrade my definitions my ideas and
conceptions
I’m here to download my future, my vision, my resolutions
a puerto boy
I’m having fun, i’m chillin, i’m vibin I’m riding
ridin the wave
taking it slow and always making progress
I’m a poor boy
My girlfriends got an only fans to pay for our float toys
i got a surf board, a body board, a hand board,
a skate board, a surfskate board, and a concrete
headboard
i dont wear undearwear
i dont wear undearwear unless i’m going somewhere
where i cant show my pubic hair
i sky dive, I ride high, I trip deep, and I love sleep
i don’t take drugs but i like to party
i don't give hugs i impregnate mamis
my mamis got babies riding doggos under palm trees
i’m a puerto boy
i’m healing i’m feeling and on the full moon i’m gleaming
i got my chakras aligned to my star ⭐ signs
i know my human design connects my life purpose to my
life coaches bank account
16
i got starlink
i got starlink to connect my zoom calls for my side hustle
I freelance on the inter-webz to design the next generation
of crypto
my money is digital but my vehicles are manual
my moto’s gas reads empty but my karma is full
when chicks ask how big are you?
i don’t know
whether to give my answer in centimeters, feet and
inches,
fists and slaps, or micrograms and slow puffs
either way the answer is not enough
you’re gonna have to see it to believe it
so put it on your tongue
chew it softly without swallowing
and let it soak in for another 5-30 minutes
then you’ll see i’m disconnected from the mainframe
societal con game
i’m un vaxxed, un taxed, and sometimes i get my legs
waxed
i’m unemployed and uninterested
i’m incompatible with 9 to 5
i’d rather lay on the beach and stay high
i need massages and fruits,
i need movement, i play beach volleyball, i swim big
waves
and i tell tall tales
i love adventure, i love risking it all,
i love pushing all the boundaries,
and making people uncomfortable
my yoga teacher is super flexible,
but i swear i didn’t stretch her out at all
i see patterns everywhere, everything is flowing
always changing, sometimes growing
i see colors you don’t even know
i receive messages even when there’s no cell phone
17
my spirit guides keep the ocean tides within my swimming
ability
the source feeds the energy i need to maintain my likability
and everything i say come with no warranty or liability
nothing makes sense
nothing makes sense
if you can’t sense that the intense incense is incensed by
your lack of sense
you better stop being so tense
or you might have what some would call a bad trip
i don’t trip
i don’t trip cause i’m already horizontal, frontal and totally
naked
my friends come to visit me in this puerto prison
i can’t escape because i can’t take the feelings of my
wakened state
to places where people are scared of hate
my friends come to visit and i show the my new world
my parents came for Christmas
and i got them the most original gift of all
an appointment with the love dimension
yeah that’s all
sometimes i eat tacos in centro and have to pooo
sometimes i see some wind breezed hair and i think of you
anyways…
i’m a puerto boy and i got puero friends
musicians, shamans, drug dealers, healers, and yoga
teachers
jujitsu fighters, guys with lighters, surfers, salsa dancers
and salsa makers, and salsa takers
i got girlfriends, girls that are friends, and girls that are
from France
i got exes that live in texas, and i got my wife, the grilfriend
and the mistress, that’s the puerto way
my friends own restaurants, hotels, and those things
where people lift barbells
18
i don’t know why sometimes i wonder if this paradise is
actually hell
19

Falling Out of It
well i’ll start with Oaxaca on christmas 2019
about how i puked moctezumas curse
caught a ride to do mushrooms in the mountains
then found myself in puerto for a festival and a ride
the end of the world happened over and over
like when cnn said trump killed a guy and there was no
internet or cell connection
i thought it was all over
and for me it was

Weird Lookin’
i was a weird lookin kid
I could’ve been 6 or 7
i knew it but i didn’t know why
i was standing in the mirror wondering…
was it the bags under my sunken eyes
or my lack of front teeth
all i knew is that there were uglier kids
and more symmetrical complete looking kids
and beautiful girls.
we were kids. maybe babies… we were all goofy if we look
back
but i was already dreaming of their eyes and wrists and
shapes in their faces and bodies
shit it’s kinda weird to think about
but when i stop to reminisce, my memories have the girls as
my age now…
or maybe stuck around 25… as i think my own self image is
stuck at 25

Commando
i always wanted to be special forces growing up
either special forces or a spy… but not 007
more like… beverly hills ninja
or what waas that
or the man from la mancha
i’m still hungry after the green curry
i have a croissant i forgot about for 2 days in the microwave

La Cumbre
La Cumbre is a special place. It’s a Hostel built into the side
of a mountain. Facing Sunset west. Sunset over the
mountains of San Jose del Pacifico. Sunset over the clouds
and under them at the same time. Sunset over your trip.
Soon you will be in the night part. The dark park.
But before that… we should explore this town. A derrumbé
town… landslide mushroom town …because the earth slides
out from under you. A town built by people literate in the
language of landslides.
My guide’s name was Guau… pronounced Wow… or mor
like… Wauw. Guau was a tour guide and a boxing coach.
His green hair boxing student was with us too. Tough little
guy. I thought Guau could be 16 and his student maybe 11. I
was wrong. I thought the town was pretty. And I assumed it
was a lot like other little mountain towns. Also wrong.
Guau stepped through the pine needle covered tracks to
show me the Mushroom cabin. A cabin in the woods facing
the sunrise. The first floor was the stem. The top floor was a
mushroom head in the clouds… with little windows breaking
the illusion of a roof. The lights were on inside… so the
mushroom was glowing.
Taha would ask if they have agua caliente? si Si hay agua
caliente.
So I start Writing.
23
I think it has to do with comfort. A cabin. Hot water. A friend
to trip with. Even though the whole point was to step out of
the comfort zone.
Step as far out of your comfort zone. And do it in style.
Comfortable. Cozy. Huggable style.
There will be pressure on the trip. Pressure from inside
and outside at the same time. The submarine maintains an
equilibrium. The shape of the hull is maintained. We go
deeper.
I admit. I think I know all of this better than you. How the
trip is gonna go. And that I’m not about to freak out. Are you?
The pressure builds and you can hear it kind of…
creaking, and the occasional vibration… like a bell in slow
motion. Like if my head had been rung. And I can feel it all
the way to my toes.
My dear friend is lagging behind. So I have to meet him
outside. At the archway. The gates to expansion.
Others are waiting too for various reasons. They didn’t do
their homework. Or they weren’t ready. You’re either fully
ready, or you’re late.
Late to be transported. In a vessel of some sort. I thought
it was a submarine… could’ve been a spaceship… or a
sonic train through a wormhole in spacetime. Headed for a
collision.
Either way - we all get in. We were born for this. We
signed a contract long ago. A shadowy figure brought it to
me… who do you remember negotiating with?
I think he said… I would get a whole life if I’m willing to
face him at the end of it. To “trade it back in” or something
like that. What a weird proposal. No discounts, trades,
swaps or upgrades for the duration of the ride. And on top of
all of that… I was going to have a mission that I wasn’t
24
allowed to remember. What a mess I thought - what kind of
operation is this? Who runs this thing?
He said I could think about it as long as I want. In eternity.
But I didn’t bother. As long as my mission is righteous I’m in.
He said it was. He told me and I agreed. Then I forgot it
anyway. “Keep your soul and spirit inside your body for the
duration of the ride” the sign said as i was taking off. Of
course I was going to put my hands up every chance I could.
Space - ships

- Andre 3000 (UGK)
He has another name on the other side and it’s also not a
he or a she… an it maybe the closest we can get in human
languages. A concept. Incomprehensible. A kind of line that
you cross. A border. Where you have to give up your pulse to
pass through. Here we call it Death.
I had to meet Death on various occasions throughout my
life. Usually I avoided eye contact. When I was young I used
to cry. Big tears. Unstoppable. They came with gasps and
cries for air. With despair. With begging for comfort.
As I got older it became more manageable. I was
confused but I was curious. I was tense, sweating from my
palms, feeling my heartbeat in my throat. And I was focused.
That I might get an answer or a clue. What the fuck is that
thing?
As I got older we became friendly in a sense… familiar
acquaintances you could say. I would invite Death to visit on
occasion with a call of risky behavior.
My favorite place to meet him was under a heavy wave in
the Pacific ocean. Tumbling and getting tubed. Getting
25
banged and dropped. One sunny day the ocean punishing
me. It beat me. And at one point he appeared. “Shit. Here we
are… Hey!” I would greet him with excitement… veins
pumping adrenaline directly into my heart. My eyes burning.
He was watching my fight. Silent. I didn’t get much of a
reaction. But the one question that he did answer was when
I gave up my struggles. When I thought I was in real trouble
and I changed my focus from the Ocean to death, and I gave
him my full attention He leaned in. I thought it was over. And
hovered in front of my face. “is it my time to go?” I asked.
“No.” He disappeared.
I survived that meeting and many more. In the ocean and
in the sky, or moving with too much horizontal velocity on a
moto that was slipping out from under me. Sometimes with
powerful psychedelics. Sometimes by holding my breath -
Iceman-Style. The only question he ever replied to was “is it
my time to go?” And only in those endless moments when he
had my full attention. There is no way for me to describe how
I got any other information. But the No carried a kind of
Know. I got a lot of hints about my life in those moments. I
think of them as tips, little bits about my mission. A mission I
can’t fully remember.
Well you can imagine at some point my curiosity became
obsession. Is it my time to go? No. No. No. Stop Asking. And
I had to pass through that stage. I’m here. I’m living.
Breathing. Life. Conscious. Exactly how it’s supposed to be.
Don’t get confused.
I got on the spaceship and I remembered. I’m supposed to
be here. I got off the spaceship, still living, and I remembered
why I came to this life.
In short it has to do with the flow of energy. Maintain and
open and receptive posture, in body, mind, and attitude.
Maintain an open heart. There is a move we are going to
make. From point A to B and back again. Over and over
again. Many times. It’s not a waste. It’s not for nothing and
nothing gets lost. Stay focused and stay close. You will start
to hear it. A to B to A to B. There is a quality to the
26
movement. Speed, distance, efficiency. You will start to hear
it. The energy comes and goes. The big electron. The
cosmic megaphone. The voice of God. Ohmmm.
The pattern reveals a shape and a shape is like a
boundary. A line between what is and what isn’t. In quantum
space that line is imaginary… it’s a line of probable
possibilities, or real and living impossibilities. You know?
I’ll tell you about my purpose, my mission, my visions and
resolutions. I’ll share everything from my star signs to my
DNA. Maybe it will say something about how we’re similar or
different - at least I’m here and you’re over there. Or is it the
other way around?

CONSULTING SKOOL
Sharing with you a little note on freedom... I feel I have to
express but in an indirect way... otherwise I start sounding
like a preachy lunatic.
I hope you already know how vast the sea of
consciousness is...
and how deep in the wilderness Truth remains King...
Everything we see is just an illusion...
And all these cliches have already been repeated... by
losers.
It's a guarantee that AI could write a better note than this,
and probably write you a book about escaping the Matrix. I
wonder why doesn't anyone ask?
It seems we are comfortably broken into atom-sized
pieces... packed into a skin suit... destined to march in
circles around the things that cause our suffering.
Asking.... did God do this? TO ME? With me? Through
me? Me
You did all this. And you'll never be free. Until your
embrace Feer and transform it.
Fear? Feer. Feel. Phil... Fill... zero. 0. nothing. free. they
say…
false
evidence
appearing
real.
That's why knowing... what is real. What is real? Nothing is
real.
28
It's crazy... but you never find it. People look for certainty...
and that's not real. They might say Death... but they can
never meet it.
The moment is also fleeting... the attention wandering...
the body crumbling...
There's no time, they say... to figure it all out. Why waste
your time on a fruitless pursuit?
The dream is real. Not even the dreamer. There is no
waking up. There is no lucidity.
Find your purpose, your Love, and live in the dream. Cast
your spells. Because here magic is real.
Without reason you return to being a mindless plus one...
A background character that's not any fun...
Checking for updates and emails and pings.
Listening to news about tragedies and things that might be
Give all that up and come back to yourself
Remember who you were before you knew there was a hell
Before someone bad could catch you and beat you
Before your actions broke infinity around you
I have to say in the end I know nothing...
Just sharing a feeling...
Hope if you take it it serves you well

Seeking personal and inner liberation,
A quest for truth, a sacred sensation,
Why, oh why, do so few attain,
The realms of self, free from the chain?
In this gritty chronicle, I shall convey,
How to break the bonds that lead astray,
First, define your freedom, make it your creed,
A unique path, not everyone's need.
II
Some yearn for wealth, others for art,
Or spiritual connection, a lifeline to start,
To discover your path, the key to your cell,
Unearth your desires, let them cast their spell.
Fear, that wicked specter, does confound,
It's the demon that keeps us bound,
Fear of the unknown, fear to be free,
But to taste true liberty, challenge it, see?
III
Risks are the gambles that fortunes unveil,
Embrace the failures, let your courage set sail,
Change is a friend, not a foe to resent,
In its winding course, our growth is lent.
Next, let your deeds sing in harmony,
With values you hold, your inner symphony,
It's not just the options, but the choices you make,
In your heart's alignment, your freedom will wake.
IV
It's not merely about doing as you please,
But pursuing your essence with sure expertise,
Act with honesty, let authenticity thrive,
In your truth, your personal freedom shall arrive.
Embrace your passion, honor your word,
In the web of life, let your impact be heard,
Respect others' rights, in your journey unfurl,
For true freedom respects, in its dance and twirl.
30
V
This pursuit is not facile, my friend, it's true,
It demands your spirit, unwavering and true,
Self-knowledge, acceptance, and love in your sight,
Change from within, and your world will ignite.
And if ever you stumble, falter, or fall,
Don't despair, don't you linger, don't you crawl,
For freedom's a journey, it's yours to reap,
To begin again, just return to the peak.
Restart from the top, let your spirit ignite,
With each new dawn, embrace the light,
In this cycle of growth, in the dance of the free,
From the depths of your soul, you'll eternally see.

LA PUNTA LEAVE THIS
so peaceful, the waves crash, the wind blows
locals speak indistinctly in the lighted part of the palapa bar
in a language I don't fully understand
I'm waiting for something magical to happen,
a transformation to a life more magnificent then I've
imagined so far
There seems to always be the question of needs, in terms
of finances
am i stuck?

XI Ferari, my dear poetic admirer,
Your message filled with rhymes and charm,
Has left me with a warm and pleasant disarm.
Jiu jitsu over karate, you inquire,
It’s a choice that sets my heart on fire.
Your words bring back that September night,
Las Cazuelas, under the Mexican moonlight,
I remember blocking the menu, oh so tall,
And as for shampoo, I recommend none at all.
Matching on date apps made me smile,
Your blush, your crush, it’s been worthwhile.
Our common interests, they do align,
From biking to cooking, it’s a wonderful sign.
Friends or more, let’s take it slow,
As the ocean waves ebb and flow.
Puerto boi, I like the sound of that,
Let’s explore, and see where we’re at.
Texting sounds like a plan,
Getting to know you, I’m already a fan.
By the ocean, let’s take a stroll,
Let’s see where this connection will unroll.
Your wishes for a wonderful week I’ll keep,
And Rumi’s words, they’re truly deep.
You are what you seek, so they say,
Let’s seek together, come what may.
Looking forward to our journey ahead,
With a smile on my face, and nothing to dread.
Feel free to text whenever you please,
Let’s build something special, with grace and ease.
