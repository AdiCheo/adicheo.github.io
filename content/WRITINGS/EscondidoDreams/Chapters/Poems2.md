SOMETHING ABOUT
ARTISTS

    #note
    Artists… we are required to be open - there is no
    question of it for us so a result is that we cannot be
    part of the normal society we live along-side - like an artifact
    that could float out of the sea and then be adopted… and
    given a purpose, used or just casually thrown back. into the
    sea. or broken.
    The Artist Heart has a flame of passion to connect with all
    the world
    my heart is a slut for every detail of love lost in time
    it’s wrinkles empathize with every cut made by those who
    forgot their act in their absent mind they became a void and
    reflected the illusion of death the helpless position of
    someone pretending to live and continuing on like a tourist
    that looks and smiles at all the things the other automatons
    photograph
    what is it to have an experience? to set a real boundary?
    how is it that enough could really be enough?

A Return

    It's a sad day
    my return to Canada
    A country of empty hope...
    Promises that come with hidden costs...
    How many have been mislead?
    Multicultural bleach
    Impersonal politeness
    Cordial disgust
    Spineless bodies propped up on a skeleton of idealism
    They want to tell me who I am?
    Interpret my experiences for me?
    Discredit me
    My toxicity, domination
    My supremacy, corruption
    My lack of struggle...
    on the basis of race, gender, sexual identity....
    the androids of justice...
    What good do they do?

INVITATIONS
WHAT is it I was working on… my limiting
behaviors… beliefs… habits
I’m here not knowing exactly how to ask for attention…
and maybe I should learn to value the silence.
There is no reality in a metal and plastic tube
Only fake wind and more packaging.
We are being delivered to another reality
Some people there are waiting for us.
Isn’t that how we got here in the first place?
My whole life I feel like I showed up to the wrong party
Like the invitation was for the house next door
But I can’t tell - isn’t it that you wanted me to come?
I thought that I was invited but then they ask…
Aren’t you happy to be here?

El Chapo
From Cancun I jumped out on the small dock to land
Isla Las Mujeres. The beach was full of families and
tourists… Not quite the Island of Women I was thinking the
title alluded to. It was Wednesday an I was supposed to be
working on problems solving some algorithms for a tech
consultancy that was sending me checks at the time. I chose
to take this day-trip instead. From my week rental I walked to
a nearby port and signed up. I was vaguely considering
connecting to some wifi during my trip to create a minimum
viable perception that I was working.
The water was blue and the waves were barely ripples. I
was told if I put the rubbery goggles on I can snorkle to see
fish, turtles, and maybe even dolphins, whales, sharks. The
sun was already beaming sweat droplets onto my forehead
and chest. Soon I was gonna have a watercolor design
imposed on my tropical print shirt. I didn’t do any research
this time. I never do research about a place. It’s like stalking
someone before you ask them out on a date. Or in modern
times a few taps to see their social profiles. I never cared
what a place wanted to be or what curators of the local
attractions wanted me to know about it. I’d rather go in not
knowing. This time I was observing a man preparing *cocos
frios* with a few eager travelers lined up infront of him. One
guy asking “son bien frios mi rey?”, I thought he was teasing.
“Si bien frios”, the old timer laughed. I didn’t know asking
how cold a coco or a beer is rarely begets an honest answer.
The Mexicans though are not being dishonest - they are
being encouraging! It’s a kind of positivity they inject into
every move. Like a mantra or prayer. “I pray this coco is cold
enough that you enjoy! And have yourself a blessed day


40

pendejo” It’s the same mantra that comes out when you ask
a local for directions to a restaurant they can’t afford. “I have
heard of it” might be the internal dialogue of your local Oxxo
guy. And then he’ll give you more or less random directions
with a tone of undaunted positivity.

There is a spark ✨
A glimpse into another
e x p e r i e n c e
you are enough
you have enough
you are invited
and welcome
don’t even worry
You Belong Here
Please bring all of you.
Leave the rest, alone.
Because here we are together

LULLABY
Ha!
I can catch death lurking
Following me through some scarcely lit streets
In dark waves crashing
But not into me
I’m ready to die
To face the abyss
Meet a god
Or replay my list
Whatever you prepare
Some ceremony
To say farewell
TODO replace image


45

Make my peace
Join the conscious eternity
Or burn away for all these sins
Well show your face
Why do you think
you need to surprise me?
I’m not waiting
I’m just ready
Is there anything else i need to see?
I’ve already been as big as i’ll be
Well i’m not in a rush either
I don’t need to go early
Some might even pretend to miss me
Or tell some story
They knew me and something
They never ask
How my shadow follows
Death looking around a corner
Waiting to for the moment
To dance with me
At least this time when we meet
I hope you don’t just disappear
Stay with me at least a bit
To get a rhythm and feel the beat
Eternal truth shines
Transparently
Rest easy my friend

Cosmic Abandonment
Well, some experiences are beyond words.
Some concepts cannot be said… it is what it is.
I had one of these transformational moments last week.
This is just an attempt to scratch the surface of that
experience.
Join me on this journey, and let each word make ripples in
your mind...
I’m always fighting something…. for something… inside…
outside…
Conspiracies… freedom… relationships… love… health…
sex… competition… friendship… traveling through.. passing
by
I’m a Man. I’m a fighter.
What you confront becomes your reality.
What you face becomes your world.
Look into a bucket… and puke your guts out…
Puke out the poison that clouds your heart…
Give up the chains that weigh on your mind.
And if you find a breath to take and then turn to look up…
Be it that the shine of stars finds your gaze…
The bright full moon electrifying your mind…
Or the early morning Sun melting your illusions…
Illusion. Of being on your own. Alone. Lost.
Remember me… remember you…
Only you can create suffering in this Life.
Only you can create pain.


47

Remember that I am you, and you Are me
Only you can create love in this World
Only you can be the creative spirit
Remember the sweetness of our time together
That you breathed space into existence
So that we could find each other again and again
Remember the harmony of our connection
That you beat the drum of Time, a perfect illusion
To show that our vibration permeates through every moment
I’ve been watching, waiting, hoping
That your dance of creativity lasts forever
That no corner of darkness exists without your presence
Well I set off in your example…
Dancing Love, breathing Life, moving through Time
And I found a place, where our lost children live…
They are broken… they are sick… they are crying for
touch.
They are Hurt… they are ugly… they are out of Luck.
They descended away… believing themselves slaves of
circumstance
They wear the chains of separation… proudly on their souls.
They are thorny… horny… and reactive…
They almost killed me… every chance they could get they
tried to bleed me
I found them at Home… I found them there…
Where I last saw you… I saw them there.
Well they need our Love… they want our light…
They sing and cry out… to know our names…
To call us to fight.
Let’s fight one time… to find our core…
Let’s love one time… just one time more.

These days…
Everyone wanted to know how to work better, harder,
faster, stronger when I was growing up. Work a week in
4 hours was a mega bestseller.
Efficiency experts were on the rise everywhere.
Do more, live more, sell more, spend more...
I was working in tech then... Agile methodologies were in
their full dick swing glory. Evangelizers, coaches and
consultants were onboarded to iterate everyone up to speed.
My impressionable friends were programmed into the
motivation epidemic ~before the influenza plandemic~
Tribes of influencers pillaged the digital landscape. Invading
the feeds of the unsuspecting with organic growth and
algorithmically calculated ads.
Leaders in thought-spaces made their bones in webinars
and TedX sharing events promoted endlessly through social
networks. Eventually herding communities they could tax to
share their tricks.
Entrepreneur was a common title back then. Gary was still
trying to make it work while a lot of my friends were raising
Seed rounds with angel investors to build the most motivated


49

bro culture startups that would disrupt the incumbent and
rape their fleeting customers.
Disruption was a winning trend. Incentivizing owners to
become renters. Property became a burden. And eventually
everyone became part of the sharing economy.
It wasn't clear where the ship was heading... Does every old
man become bitter? or is it only when society is crumbling?
Well I met a bitter old man that saw it coming. His name was
Jaak. Jaak spent his time growing tomatoes and Poblano
peppers while blasting old-time rock n roll.
He checked into his PC to check on research of corruption,
manipulation, and manufactured consent. Everyone else


50

Sketch of Jaak
called those things conspiracies collectively.
I thought of them as grand conspiracies when I met Jaak.
Some were laughable to me... Auszwitz denial, implantable
microchips, mind-altering 5G antenas, gain of function
research, and so on...
Other things seemed more plausible... economic
manipulations, supply chain interferences, groups dedicated
to globalization and progressive ideologies... I didn't consider
globalization to be a threat at all.
Jaak also warned about mandated experimnetal injections
and class-based travel and economies. I remember assuring
him there was no chance that would go mainstream. He
always said he hoped I was right.
Well Jaak was extraordinarily free. A man you could only kill.
You couldn't corrupt him with luxuries, money or threats. I
had a sense that he risked being put in a cage only to be
beaten with a stick... I imagine that's what they want to do to
people like him.
Well Jaak was 68 when the plandemic was released unto the
dormant public. Jaak had been trying to wake them up for
decades. Now it was his old dismissive friends that were
blowing up his phone at all hours of the night to ask for
guidance. How did he know and prepare?
I saw it all unfold with a consistent sense of incredulous
amusement. I only started getting anxious and depressed
later... When my group-chat of digital nomads collectively
labeled me a danger and threat for promoting the idea of
personal freedom, I got booted and avoided in real life too.
Of course there were others that welcomed me.
Well since all that I've been radicalized. I've become radically
free. Radically honest. Radically independent.
That's to say... I've been in the sidelines before, a passive
bystander in the observation of decaying social norms.
Now I'm activated. Like charcoal.


51

I'm an artist, devoloping my craft with care. Not to become a
sensation or turn a profit. Not to become an influencer. My
humble aim seems, in it's intierety, unnatainable: To live and
breathe in a way, and to use words in a way, in which,
another might find it to point to a compassionate Way of
Living.
I am a teacher as well in this sense. A teacher in the method
of my teachers. The teachers of the subtle way of
questioning the world. The community of teachers turning
over the settled stones of normality and discerning the
insects and worms that are found sheltered beneath.
I'm a scientist in the dark caves of hell. The caverns that
contain the demons and traumas in my heart. I dig and
unearth the stories that have been burried under scar tissue
and reactive defensive mechanisms.
Well the work of freedom is not easy. There's no demand for
it in the market so the average salary can't buy you a slice of
banana. Freedom is not accepted by manipulative friends or
needy parents. It's not promoted in dogmatic churches or
support groups for the fiercely self-interested.
Freedom exists as an opportunity to those who retire
themselves voluntarily. To stop the voluntary compliance and
contribution.
Some retreat.
Some Surrender.
Some call it meditation.
Surely, more would try it at least out of curiousity... but
there's a catch. A fear that you might get stuck in freedom.
You might get bored to infinity.
Or that you'd be lost never to return.
I think the way back is clear to see. But the truth is I am
stuck in Freedom. It's just that it's voluntary.
I don't know why I would go back? To slavery that is...


52

You could kill me.
Or put me in a cage or beat me with a stick.
But you can never corrupt me into compliance... into quiet
abidance of your made up rules.
Like I said I'm still learning. I owe a great debt of gratitude to
Jaak and my teachers. The ones that pointed the way
through their actions and words.
The ones that quietly retired to the space of freedom. Care.
Power. Love.
