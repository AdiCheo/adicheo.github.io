Prologue
A meditation
Follow. Each. Word.
Stop. Breathe. Sigh. Aaaaaah Inhale. Shhhhh. Exhale.
A heart beats in the distant space.
That space belongs to you. Dear reader.
Listen. Closer. Tuh-tum tuh-tum. Like heel-first footsteps.
Tuh-tum. Tuh-tum.
Step through the tunnel. The Portal. The doorway leads
you closer. Tuh-tum. The footsteps get louder. The heart
beat sounds stronger. The ancient halls amplify the
instrument at the center of the symphony. Listen. It’s you.
Your Heart is Magnificent.
I have never met you. And I already know…
I Love You.
Normally they wait a long time. And they search for a
special time. They wait to say the important, the obvious, the
known.
Love is all.
It is how I get to tell you anything at all. It is the only
reason we communicate. It is the only reason you can listen.
And it’s why you keep reading.

Thank you. For joining me on this journey
Now I invite you to step with me into a world of dreams. A
world I have lived and loved. Dreams that you can live and
love. Dreams you can imagine. Dreams you can create.
The words in this book seem ordinary. They have been
crafted specifically for you. Each word dipped in magic
serum. Enchanted with ancient instruments. These words
are simple and among them are keys. The hidden keys are
my actual gift, that I want to share with you. These keys are
protected by dedicated keepers. Delivered by doves and
eagles flying together. By dragons and geese. By pelicans
and songbirds.
The words are containers. The keys come in grains of
magic dust. packaged in these words. Take easch grain into
your heart and let the resonance of your heart shape this
dust into the form of a harmonic key. The key will allow you
to unlock a world of dreams. Timeless dreams. Shared
Experiences. [of love and collaboration]
Imagine a key to a world of dreams. Each dream a
complete life.
A dream of healing. A dream of safety. A dream where you
live your dreams.
These dreams already exist. The dream that unlocks your
heart and the power of you love exists. The dream that
enables you to forgive everyone for everything forever, that
dream exists. The dream that reminds of your Gifts and how
important it is for you to share them with the world. That
dream exists.
The journey comes with a warning. It’s not for everyone.
Beware:
These dreams will change you. Awaken you. Empower
you. Expand you… and eventually… these dreams will kill
you.
They will kill who you think you are.
10
They will kill the person you should be.
They will kill the you that would have been.
They will also kill some of your friends. Friends that may
have been with you a long time. These friends will die in your
dreams.
Friends that kept you small.
Friends that kept you playing safe.
Friends that shaped you into who they thought you should
be.
You will find that that without them you are no less. That
you are not lonely or alone. That you are safe and
courageous. You will find that you are supported and
assisted by countless other friends - allies.
Allies that empower you.
Allies that magnify you.
Allies that challenge you to explore, to discover, and to
create.
Stop. Breathe. Yahhhhh … Huahhhh

A drum beats in the distance. A mysterious drummer kicks
in a wild place. A dense forest. The forest breeze breathes
and the drum beats. An instrument of peace in a
battleground of Love. In the wild, love wins. Love consumes
love. Love over-powering love. Plants and trees hold the soil.
Transmuting sunshine gold into green. Green becomes
yellow. Yellow becomes brown. Brown turns into Red.
Red dust. Red like blood. Red like heart. Red and green
compliments battle it out. Complimentary in the duality of life.
Red and Green. Divorciados. Separados. Magnetic.

Polarizing.
You find yourself Red. In a sea of Green. A red ant in a
field of grass blades stretching endlessly towards the sky. A
Actually breathe… and try to hear your heart before moving

on.
Divorced. Separated.

red beetle. A red ladybug. Red dot with black dots. Dot dot
dot. Flying in a green galaxy. Pulsing. Vibrating. Buzzzzz
And then you notice the drum breats. Duh dum… Duh
dum.
Ooohhhmmm you buzz through this dimension. Ohm-
bum-bum
OOOHHHMMMmmm…… OOOHHHMMMmmm……
Duh-dum…………………..Duh-Dum………………….
The wind blows in. The wind blows out. You breathe. I
breathe.
Each word brings a grain of sand… or a fluff of magic dust.
Self-assembling material. Reacting to your resonance
machine. Your heart.
I invite you to dream. Dream these dreams. And live your
dreams. Love the way you live. Your life was made for it.
Maybe you never forgot that you are here. A love machine.
A loving creature. A living creator. A breathing animator. A
manifesting animal. A harmonious generator. Being. Pure
Love magnetizing. A love-decision-making machine.
You have always been. be. being.
You have been Lov-ing longer than remember-ing was
even a th-ing.
I invite you to stop remembering and just BE.
Later, we will be while remembering. Eventually we will be
creating. Realizing dreams by mixing memories, reality, and
fantasy. In parts, like a cocktail, mix parts 3:2:1, shake,
shake, shake, pop. Pour. A new moment.
A new World. A new Word. A new Me. New. Be…
