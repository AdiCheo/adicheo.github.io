# The Mexican Interlude

(A beach in Puerto Escondido. ADI sits on the sand, staring at the ocean. SANA enters, carrying a suitcase.)

![A surreal painting depicting a Mexican beach scene. In the foreground, Adi and Sana sit cross-legged on the sand, their eyes closed in meditation. Behind them, the ocean stretches to the horizon, its waves transforming into swirling, colorful patterns reminiscent of Romanian folk art. In the sky, a large, ethereal zburător (flying spirit) soars overhead, leaving a trail of glowing code in its wake. The sun is setting, casting a warm, golden light over the scene, blending the colors of the Mexican and Romanian flags. In the distance, a troița (Romanian roadside cross) stands on a small island, serving as a bridge between two worlds.](/mexicaninterlude.png)


SANA: I've arrived.

ADI: (without turning) So you have.

SANA: You didn't think I would come.

ADI: I didn't think you wouldn't.

(Silence. The sound of waves crashing.)

SANA: (sitting beside him) What now?

ADI: Now we wait.

SANA: For what?

ADI: For Insight. For clarity. For the next step in this cosmic dance.

SANA: (laughing softly) Always the philosopher.

ADI: Always the dreamer.

(They sit in silence for a moment.)

ADI: Do you remember the night of Sânziene?

SANA: How could I forget?

ADI: Sometimes I wonder if it was real.

SANA: Does it matter?

ADI: Perhaps not.

(A group of SURFERS passes by, their boards under their arms.)

SURFER 1: Gnarly waves today, bro!

ADI: (to Sana) See? Even the ocean speaks in code.

SANA: And what does it say?

ADI: That life is a series of waves. We ride some, we crash on others.

SANA: And Insight 3?

ADI: Another wave. Perhaps the biggest yet.

(The stage darkens, then brightens. It's now November. ADI and SANA are in a conference room in Acapulco.)

SANA: Is this what you expected?

ADI: I've learned not to expect anything.

SANA: Yet you're here.

ADI: Yet I'm here.

(A FACILITATOR enters.)

FACILITATOR: Welcome to Insight 3. Are you ready to transform your life?

ADI: (to Sana) Are we ever truly ready?

SANA: (to Facilitator) We're here, aren't we?

(The FACILITATOR nods and exits. ADI and SANA face each other.)

ADI: Do you think this will change anything?

SANA: Everything changes, Adi. Even when we stand still.

ADI: But what about us? What about Romania? What about the wellness center?

SANA: What about them?

ADI: They're waiting.

SANA: Like we're waiting now?

ADI: Perhaps.

(Silence. The sound of the ocean can be heard faintly in the distance.)

SANA: You know, in Romania, we have a saying...

ADI: (interrupting) "I am a harmonious creative man sharing joy and wisdom."

SANA: (surprised) How did you know?

ADI: I didn't. It just felt right.

(They both laugh, then fall silent again.)

ADI: Sana?

SANA: Yes?

ADI: Do you think we'll ever stop waiting?

SANA: For what?

ADI: For life to begin.

SANA: (taking his hand) Adi, my love, it already has.

(The lights fade as they sit hand in hand, waiting for Insight, for clarity, for the next wave in the cosmic ocean of existence.)
