# Return to Coyoacán

Adrian stepped off the bus with a hum of energy that seemed to blend with the murmur of Coyoacán’s cobblestone streets. The city had the scent of jasmine and sunburned clay that clung to his skin like a favorite old coat. It was as if each corner held a memory, waiting in ambush, laced with the bitter sweetness of unspoken words. Walking along the road shaded by jacaranda trees in late bloom, he felt the city press upon him, a tapestry of the old and the new, knotted with silences.

Toria’s apartment wasn’t far—an old colonial place painted in shades of cobalt and marigold. The colors were louder than his thoughts, but he moved quietly, like a man who’d found his own pulse. Toria opened the door, her hair tousled, her laughter as rich as he remembered. This was where they’d once poured wine like it was water and danced in narrow rooms until the walls seemed to sigh.

“Look at you,” she whispered, almost to herself, as if trying to convince her memory. They sat together that evening, a shared silence between them like a third presence, drinking mezcal as they recalled that wild, moonlit summer in Madrid. Back then, they had been too young to know how little they knew. Adrian spoke of his new life, of moments that had brought him light and others that had broken him open. He spoke of a love that had taught him to let go and return to himself all at once.

As his words filled the air, Toria’s gaze wavered, her hands folding like unanswered questions. She was not jealous; jealousy was too shallow for what she felt. It was a quiet envy that she barely recognized, a pain of what might have been, seasoned with a trace of longing for the person she once thought Adrian might become. Her fingers traced the rim of her glass, a trembling reflection of her heart’s surface.

“You know, settling down isn’t as easy as it sounds, even here,” she confessed, almost laughing, though her eyes held the weight of sleepless nights. “It’s like… carrying something fragile on uneven ground.” She trailed off, her vulnerability slipping like a stone dropped into the clear water of their shared memories.

Through her words, Adrian glimpsed a piece of himself, a former self he had left behind yet carried within him like an invisible scar. He touched her hand lightly, a gesture without expectation, only gratitude, for the ways they had held each other and the spaces they had made alone.

As he navigated the streets of Coyoacán, Adrian's mind swirled with thoughts. This place felt different yet achingly familiar, like a song he had forgotten the lyrics to but could still hum. The jacaranda trees, with their vibrant purple blossoms, reminded him of the fleeting nature of beauty and life. They were a symbol of both past and present, blooming in decay, just as he felt—caught between who he was and who he had become.

Later that evening, as they sifted through old photographs, Toria paused, her fingers brushing over a small box tucked away on a shelf. “I have something for you,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper. She opened the box to reveal a delicate silver bracelet, engraved with intricate designs that spoke of their shared history.

“This was ours,” she said, her eyes glistening. “I thought you might want it back. A keepsake to mark your journey forward.” 

Adrian took the bracelet, feeling the cool metal against his skin. It was a tangible reminder of their past, a piece of the life they had shared. “Thank you,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “It means a lot.”

As they stepped outside, the jacaranda trees stood tall, their blossoms scattered like small, violet ghosts beneath their feet. Adrian felt a surge of nostalgia, a bittersweet reminder that beauty could be born from letting go. The trees whispered secrets of the past, urging him to embrace the present and the future.

In the midst of their conversation, Adrian's phone buzzed, a reminder of his time back in Romania. He had been trying to schedule a time to talk to Sana, but the eight-hour time difference made it challenging. He felt a pang of guilt, torn between the past he was reconnecting with and the future he was building.

“Everything okay?” Toria asked, noticing his distraction.

“Just… life,” he replied, forcing a smile. “Trying to balance it all.”

As the evening wore on, Adrian realized that this moment with Toria was not just about closure; it was about understanding the complexities of love, loss, and growth. He was not just returning to Coyoacán; he was returning to himself, ready to embrace all the facets of his identity.

The vibrant streets of Coyoacán echoed with laughter and music, a reminder that life was a tapestry woven with threads of joy and sorrow. Adrian felt a sense of peace wash over him, knowing that he was exactly where he needed to be.
