# Sânziene

Sânziene, also known as Drăgaica, is a Romanian midsummer celebration that takes place on June 24th, coinciding with the Christian feast of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist. This ancient tradition is deeply rooted in Romanian folklore and has parallels with other European midsummer festivities.

The celebration is named after the Sânziene, fairy-like creatures in Romanian mythology. These beings are believed to be beautiful maidens who live in forests or fields, possessing the power to bestow fertility, love, and good fortune. The night of Sânziene is considered magical, when the heavens open and various rituals can be performed.

Key aspects of the Sânziene celebration include:

1. Flower crowns: Young women weave crowns of [[Galium verum]] (yellow bedstraw), known as "sânziene" flowers.

2. Divination rituals: Various practices are performed to predict future spouses or fortunes.

3. Bonfires: People jump over fires for purification and good luck.

4. Gathering of medicinal plants: Herbs collected on this night are believed to have enhanced healing properties.

The concept of Sânziene has been explored in Romanian literature and folklore:

- [[Mihail Sadoveanu]]'s novel "[[Nopțile de Sânziene]]" (The Nights of Sânziene) delves into the mystical aspects of the celebration.

- [[Mircea Eliade]]'s "[[Noaptea de Sânziene]]" (The Forbidden Forest) uses the Sânziene night as a central theme, exploring concepts of time and destiny.

Parallels in other cultures:

- [[Midsummer]] celebrations in Scandinavian countries
- [[Ivan Kupala]] Night in Slavic traditions
- [[St. John's Eve]] in various European countries

The Sânziene tradition reflects the deep connection between Romanian culture and nature, blending pagan beliefs with Christian elements. It continues to be an important part of Romanian cultural identity, bridging the past and present.
