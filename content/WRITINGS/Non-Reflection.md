<p>Afi stirs, sunlight filtering in softly through the slatted wooden blinds in his hotel room in Mexico City. His mind is still tinged with the echoes of last night—the primal heartbeat of the drum, the hypnotic loops and harmonies of ancient chants mixing seamlessly with modern beats. It was a night of celebration, a visceral tribute to the Day of the Dead, where Afi had joined in the rhythmic swell of voices and energy, feeling themselves dissolve into the collective soundscape, free and powerful.</p><p>The memory fills him with a sense of exhilaration, a spark he’s determined to carry into his day. Rising from the bed, he stands for a moment, feeling the weight of the night and the call to carry that same energy forward—into his goals, his purpose. Afi knows today is a day to set a routine, one that reflects his drive for influence, leadership, and guidance. As a mental projector, he feels the subtle calling to channel his insights for others.</p>
<p>He starts with grounding: taking deep, purposeful breaths, he centers himself in the present, feeling the connection between his body and the city around him. As he opens his eyes, he envisions the steps he’ll take next. Afi feels an image forming, one that guides him towards the heart of his power and clarity, something both primal and deliberate.</p><p></p><p>Afi takes a few moments to jot down his intention: to lead, to be an anchor and a guide. He decides he will step outside, breathing in the lively energy of Mexico City, and find a place to reflect and set the tone for his day. He senses the ancient power of the Day of the Dead ceremony from last night isn’t done with him yet; there’s something more it wants to reveal.</p>
