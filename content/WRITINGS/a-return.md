<p>It's a sad day<br>my return to Canada<br>A country of empty hope...<br>Promises that come with hidden costs...<br>How many have been mislead?</p><p>Multicultural bleach<br>Impersonal politeness<br>Cordial disgust</p><p>Spineless bodies propped up on a skeleton of idealism<br>They want to tell me who I am?<br>Interpret my experiences for me?<br>Discredit me<br>My toxicity, domination<br>My supremacy, corruption<br>My lack of struggle...</p><p>on the basis of race, gender, sexual identity....<br>the androids of justice...</p><p>What good do they do?</p>
