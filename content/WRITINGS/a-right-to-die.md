<p>Labelled to suffer<br>Unable to breathe<br>Break my soul<br>For Eternity<br>Label me as covid19<br>Another laid off employee<br>I guess you had enough of me<br>I gave you my time<br>You set me free<br>A ticket system<br>To a different scene<br>A place where i’m just a casualty<br>This war is not worth fighting in<br>before you check where i’ve been<br>Who i’ve touched and who i’ve seen<br>I’d rather die in obscurity<br>Your bullshit screams</p>
