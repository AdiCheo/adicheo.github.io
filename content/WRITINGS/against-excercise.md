<p>I started reading <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/536067/against-everything-by-mark-greif/">Against Everything.</a>..<br>really enjoyed the first one on exercise...<br>funny, witty, hits close enough to home...<br>luckily for me it narrowly missed my interactions with excersie...<br>which do more closely resemle the athenian gymnasiums referenced....<br>I've always been more drawn to MMA gyms where men (and women) struggle to dominate each other through technique and strength...<br>to learn together how to properly defend and control ones own body...</p><p>i relate a lot to the parallel of weight gyms with doctors offices...<br>and having been muscular enough when i used to go there i enjoyed the erotic nature of grunting and groaning my way through big lifts<br>i also used to keep an excel of my numbers.. personal records... highest attempts at each exercise etc...<br>i had a very tense relationship with those excels... using them for motivation...<br>and sometimes pushing against those numbers in a way that led me to failiure...<br>to injuries and damage that forced me to retreat from my sculpting efforts... sometimes for a few days.. at worst for a few months</p><p>i retreated from public exercise early...<br>eventually i retired from private exercise too...<br>now my relationship with exercise (for the sake of maintenance) is that...<br>when i sit for too long i get up and roll and do some downward dogs or squats to help my blood flow and wake up a bit<br>every now and then I take a class in yoga because a friend is teaching...<br>mostly i just find a pickup game of football or beach volleyball<br>i'll keep enjoying sport and the shared experience of a movement class probably for my whole life</p><p>the main point though is that..<br>exercise for the sake of maintenance was commercially extracted from private life and made into a central piece of public life with huge gyms, joggers, spin, etc<br>in general people that are obsessed with exercise are not necessarily healthy<br>people that are obsessed with food are not necessarily healthy<br>the extreme spirals that health / fitness / nutrition obsession bring are often damaging to the body and consistently create mental stresses or antisocial behaviour...</p><p>people have to see through the bullshit of the fitness, nutrition, health industires... <br>and there's no easy solution to that.</p>
