<p>I came alone<br>To a paradise<br>Knowing only nomads<br>In digital space</p><p>Connections open<br>Links established<br>We uploaded our thoughts<br>And stacked our calendars<br>High frequency gatherings<br>Hard drives for adventures<br>Operating with altered states<br>Processing our traumas<br>New experiences downloaded<br>The network was growing<br>Our software evolved<br>We developed our feelings<br>Pixelated intentions<br>Became retina clear<br>The shared cloud - we thought<br>Could not contain fear</p><p>The system seemed perfect<br>When malware invaded<br>Our games got glitchy<br>Our parties partitioned<br>The volleyballs we tapped<br>Over a net<br>That didn’t stop the transmission<br><br>An antivirus with no updates<br>The pop-ups were saying<br>“Shut down your programs<br>Accept the procedures<br>RUN home and take cover<br>A spray of infection<br>Will void the warranty<br>Terminate the algorithms<br>That calculate your love<br>And exit the window<br>of your life”</p><p>I found myself running slow<br>High temperature fear<br>Would light up my nerves<br>Liquid cooled fevers<br>Would shake up my head</p><p>Some friends come<br>With terms and conditions<br>Some love comes<br>With a temporary trial<br>I avoid recurring membership fees<br>And endless scrolling feeds</p><p>Some old systems crashed<br>And can’t be recharged<br>Set a reminder<br>“We do not live forever”<br>Spend time Pay attention<br>Value the power<br>Because the battery drains<br>And what you haven’t done<br>You will do never</p><p>Freedom to live<br>Freedom to love<br>Seek pardon<br>Give gratitude<br>Be happy<br>To all</p>
