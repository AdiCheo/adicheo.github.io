<p>When I was in High School starting to feel different - thinking more about business or tech as career fields. I didn't realize writing was not a career choice. But then in HS I watched Californication (TV Show) and I idolized the protagonist, Hank Moody, who re-introduced me to rock and roll and other things that I had never even heard of. But mostly I wanted to be a player at that time... I was about 16. I could see in Hank some qualities that I really wanted to adopt. He seemed immune to the consequences that the world tirelessly punished him with (usually by his own doing). The only thing that mattered to him was his self criticism.</p>
