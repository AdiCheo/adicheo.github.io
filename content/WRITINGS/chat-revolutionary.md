<p></p><p>After inflating case and death numbers using a PCR test that can be manipulated to test positive for viral load on a fruit the WHO is now SILENTLY changing orders on how the test should be used.</p><p><br></p><p>All this in light of the new vaccine surely a case will be made to highlight how surprisingly effective the results of tyrannical health directives have been when overnight a large percent of the false positives will stop coming up.</p><p><br></p><p>I would call for all of the people who have been negatively affected by this test to seek compensation through the courts. All people who have been forced to pay for a test should get their money back.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>_______</em></p><p><br></p><p>Exerpt from ![https://web.archive.org/web/20201218074855/https://principia-scientific.com/who-finally-admits-covid19-pcr-test-has-a-problem/]</p><p><br></p><p>The World Health Organization WHO is now clearly looking to distance itself from the fatally flawed test as a growing number of lawsuits are processing through the courts exposing the insanity of relying on a test that even the inventor, Professor Kary B. Mullis said was never designed to diagnose diseases. [1]</p><p><br></p><p>This  WHO-admitted “Problem” comes in the wake of international lawsuits exposing the incompetence and malfeasance of public health officials and policymakers for reliance on a diagnostic test not fit for purpose.</p><p><br></p><p>This World Health Organization admission is that the crux of the “problem” is a wholly arbitrary cycling process which “means that many cycles were required to detect virus. In some circumstances, the distinction between background noise and actual presence of the target virus is difficult to ascertain.”</p><p><br></p><p>See the WHO Notice on their site.</p>
