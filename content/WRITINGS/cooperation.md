<p>It doesn’t hurt to be clear<br>I don’t owe you anything<br>I can’t solve your problems<br>You are not my responsibility<br>You are your own</p><p>Try to understand<br>I want to be with you<br>I want to enjoy the gifts of this world<br>The material, sensual, emotional knots<br>And I want you</p><p>So I need to take care of myself<br>Solve my problems<br>Clear out the obstacles<br>Be free<br>Be open<br>To feel</p><p>And you<br>Can join me<br>By doing the same</p><p>We both have things to do</p>
