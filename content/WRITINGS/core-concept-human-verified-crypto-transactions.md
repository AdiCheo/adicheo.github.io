<p>A cryptocurrency that requires a <strong>real-world action (photo &amp; puzzle solution)</strong> as a proof-of-humanity to validate transactions. Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies that rely on computational proof-of-work or stake-based consensus, this system enforces a human-only transaction limit and rewards both sender and receiver for successfully verifying transactions.</p><hr><p><strong>1. Key Features</strong></p><p>• <strong>Human-Verified Transactions</strong> → Transactions are only confirmed if both sender and receiver submit a real-world proof (photo + puzzle).</p><p>• <strong>No Automated Trading</strong> → No bots, no algorithmic trading, no high-frequency trading (HFT).</p><p>• <strong>Proof-of-Humanity (PoH)</strong> → The verification process ensures only humans can transact.</p><p>• <strong>Human Validators (Payment Processors)</strong> → Payments must be manually reviewed by a randomly assigned human processor to finalize the transaction.</p><p>• <strong>Built-in Profit Mechanism</strong> → Every validated transaction generates a small profit split between sender and receiver.</p><hr><p><strong>2. Implementation Strategy</strong></p><p><strong>A. Blockchain Design</strong></p><p>• <strong>Consensus Mechanism:</strong> Hybrid between <strong>Proof of Humanity</strong> (PoH) and <strong>Proof of Work</strong> (PoW)</p><p>• <strong>Transaction Verification:</strong> Instead of mining, transactions require:</p><p>1. <strong>Sender</strong> submits a transaction request with a proof-of-humanity challenge.</p><p>2. <strong>Receiver</strong> confirms and submits their proof-of-humanity.</p><p>3. <strong>Randomly assigned validator</strong> (another human in the network) approves the transaction.</p><p>4. <strong>Transaction is recorded on-chain</strong> only if all 3 steps are successful.</p><p></p><p><strong>B. Proof-of-Humanity Challenge</strong></p><p>To validate a transaction, both sender and receiver must:</p><p>• Upload a <strong>real-time photo</strong> (facial verification, hand gesture, or unique timestamp).</p><p>• Solve a <strong>puzzle or challenge</strong> (simple CAPTCHA-like problem to prevent deepfake automation).</p><p>• The validator checks and <strong>approves or rejects</strong> based on authenticity.</p><p></p><p><strong>C. Payment Processor Role</strong></p><p>• A <strong>third-party validator</strong> (randomly assigned human) reviews the transaction request.</p><p>• If approved, the transaction is processed, and they receive a <strong>small % reward</strong>.</p><p>• If they <strong>reject falsely</strong>, they lose reputation points (prevents abuse).</p><p></p><p><strong>D. Profit Mechanism</strong></p><p>• Every verified transaction <strong>generates a micro-profit</strong> (via small inflationary minting or transaction fee redistribution).</p><p>• The profit is <strong>split between sender and receiver</strong>.</p><p>• Validators get an additional <strong>fee for their work</strong>.</p><p></p><hr><p><strong>3.
