</figure><p></p><p>This is the year that I go back to school... as a kind of student/teacher.</p><p>I need to take a structured learning process to investigate the arts and sciences in a new way and to share this exploration with those who share my feeling that we have been robbed of a real education. </p><p>We have been strictly conditioned against the sensitivity required to engage with this life in a meaningful way. </p><p>We have been sculpted into experts of some narrow field of productivity of one kid or another...<br>we do not look outside of our bubble.... <br>we check the credentials of those who tell us about the arid landscape beyond our grasp... <br>and even if the credentials line up... we actively ignore and censor and ridcule those that oppose the popular narratives... the approved narratives...</p><p>The approved narrative is that it's all just too complex to grasp...<br>the economy...<br>the political landscape...<br>the new global age...</p><p>We should just worry about doing our jobs (from home - our new prison) and we should catch up on our favourite show. The show where we get to watch the revolutionaries at work. So that we don't have to get off the couch.</p>
