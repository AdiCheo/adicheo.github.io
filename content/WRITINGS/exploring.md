<p>I wake to apricity—</p><p>golden warmth spilling through crepuscular skies.</p><p>A susurrus of wind rustles the gossamer curtains,</p><p>and birds compose their cacophony</p><p>in a mellifluous hymn to the day.</p><p><br></p><p>Yet here I lie, beneath the weight of sonder,</p><p>hearing an alarm in the distance—</p><p>a quixotic sound, like a world war echo,</p><p>though there are no wars here,</p><p>only waves and winds,</p><p>earthquakes stirring the labyrinthine depths.</p><p>And it is not their season.</p><p><br></p><p>The people outside are halcyon,</p><p>their laughter ebullient,</p><p>washing the streets with life.</p><p>They clean, they work, they wander to the sea,</p><p>unfazed by time’s ineffable march.</p><p>But I, in this bed, feel the ineffable, too—</p><p>not its beauty, but its pull.</p><p><br></p><p>I wonder where my minutes have fled,</p><p>ephemeral as petrichor.</p><p>What shape has time carved in my chest?</p><p>What stories will I tell of this paradise,</p><p>of its vellichor mornings, its pulchritude?</p><p>Will I tell them at all?</p><p><br></p><p>The butterflies in my belly take flight,</p><p>their wings brushing against truths I obfuscate:</p><p>I live in paradise,</p><p>but do I live?</p><p><br></p><p>The day waits outside,</p><p>but for now,</p><p>I close my eyes against its demands</p><p>and let the wind whisper me</p><p>into a world of syzygy and dreams.</p>
