<p>Well the video won't be quite what you expect.<br>The Edison Ford Museum is probably more famous for the Laboratory and Workshops on the property... sadly these were closed when we arrived.</p><p>On the other hand, my visit to the winter properties of these gentlemen was a review of their family spaces. The houses, yards, private studies, bedrooms, gardens, swimming pools, and waterfront.</p><p>The Christmas decorations were way overdone. I counted 7 Christmas tress in the limited spaces we had access to... wonder how many others were set up. I question why the foundation would decide to decorate the houses in that way... surely not accurate to how they used to be.</p><p>The buildings themselves from the houses to the garages and sheds have been kept in excellent condition. There is a feeling that things were made to last, with impeccable quality. Every desk seems to be designed well and Â built to last well past a lifetime.</p><p>Strangely, the statue of Edison was decorated with an iconic 2020 face-mask... Somehow I doubt he would have succumb to the plandemic propaganda machine namely Covid-19. Plus... he would have been part of the exempt elite to which the imposed rules fail to apply... anyway...</p><p>As we made our way onto the property we were reminded to keep our masks on at all times... even though we spent most of our time wandering outside.</p>
