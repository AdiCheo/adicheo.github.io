<p>Amigos :) </p><p>It's starting to dawn on me that I'm leaving this paradise soon... <br>for a undetermined amout of time... <br>probably florida, toronto, eu, before i return... let's predict...<br>mid of next year?</p><p>I’m gonna find a portal out of this vortex of surf bums and beach boobies into the world of corona lockdowns and winter weather. <br>Sometimes I ask myself why... <br>but then I know family comes first &lt;3</p><p>Meanwhile... Looking to recruit some member for my plans of a global revolution against the forces of individual freedom... If you feel like </p><ul><li>personal power, </li><li>individual freedom, and </li><li>institutional anarchy </li></ul><p>are right for you... let’s grab a coffee while I’m still here.</p><p>Otherwise.... Camping Saturday, guiding some <em><strong>D</strong></em>imensional <strong><em>M</em></strong>ind <strong><em>T</em></strong>rips next week, and gonna pass through Chiapas before I get very far away. </p><blockquote>Let me know if you wanna join me for any of these or any other ideas to fill my schedule before I bid y’all farewell.</blockquote><p>Finally, I have some books, shirts, a gas bbq, and miscellaneous items to get rid of before I depart... Let me know if you wanna peruse any of the items. Starting bid at $0 for any and all.</p>
