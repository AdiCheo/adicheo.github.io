<p>Sharing with you a little note on freedom... I feel I have to express but in an indirect way... otherwise I start sounding like a preachy lunatic. </p><p>I hope you already know how vast the sea of consciousness is... <br>and how deep in the wilderness Truth remains King... <br>Everything we see is just an illusion...<br>And all these cliches have already been repeated... by losers.</p><p>It's a guarantee that AI could write a better note than this, and probably write you a book about escaping the Matrix. I wonder why doesn't anyone ask?</p><p>It seems we are comfortably broken into atom-sized pieces... packed into a skin suit... destined to march in circles around the things that cause our suffering.</p><p>Asking.... did God do this?

Why waste your time on a fruitless pursuit?</p><p>The dream is real. Not even the dreamer. There is no waking up. There is no lucidity.</p><p>Find your purpose, your Love, and live in the dream. Cast your spells. Because here magic is real.</p><p>Without reason you return to being a mindless plus one...<br>A background character that's not any fun... <br>Checking for updates and emails and pings.<br>Listening to news about tragedies and things that might be</p><p>Give all that up and come back to yourself<br>Remember who you were before you knew there was hell<br>Before someone bad could catch you and beat you<br>Before your actions broke infinity around you</p><p>I have to say in the end I know nothing...<br>Just sharing a feeling...<br>Hope if you take it it serves you well</p><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">I</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">Seeking personal and inner liberation,<br>A quest for truth, a sacred sensation,<br>Why, oh why, do so few attain,<br>The realms of self, free from the chain?</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">In this gritty chronicle, I shall convey,<br>How to break the bonds that lead astray,<br>First, <strong>define your freedom, </strong>make it your creed,<br>A unique path, not everyone's need.</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">II</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">Some yearn for wealth, others for art,<br>Or spiritual connection, a lifeline to start,<br>To discover your path, the key to your cell,<br>Unearth your desires, let them cast their spell.</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">Fear, that wicked specter, does confound,<br>It's the demon that keeps us bound,<br>Fear of the unknown, fear to be free,<br>But to taste true liberty, challenge it, see?</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">III</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">Risks are the gambles that fortunes unveil,<br>Embrace the failures, let your courage set sail,<br>Change is a friend, not a foe to resent,<br>In its winding course, our growth is lent.</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">Next, let your deeds sing in harmony,<br>With values you hold, your inner symphony,<br>It's not just the options, but the choices you make,<br>In your heart's alignment, your freedom will wake.</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">IV</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">It's not merely about doing as you please,<br>But pursuing your essence with sure expertise,<br>Act with honesty, let authenticity thrive,<br>In your truth, your personal freedom shall arrive.</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">Embrace your passion, honor your word,<br>In the web of life, let your impact be heard,<br>Respect others' rights, in your journey unfurl,<br>For true freedom respects, in its dance and twirl.</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">V</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">This pursuit is not facile, my friend, it's true,<br>It demands your spirit, unwavering and true,<br>Self-knowledge, acceptance, and love in your sight,<br>Change from within, and your world will ignite.</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">And if ever you stumble, falter, or fall,<br>Don't despair, don't you linger, don't you crawl,<br>For freedom's a journey, it's yours to reap,<br>To begin again, just return to the peak.</blockquote><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">Restart from the top, let your spirit ignite,<br>With each new dawn, embrace the light,<br>In this cycle of growth, in the dance of the free,<br>From the depths of your soul, you'll eternally see.</blockquote>
