<p>Hey love,<br><br>How are you? What‚Äôs bringing you joy lately?<br><br>You might‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôve been pretty quiet in the last while as i tried to wrap my head around what is going on and the right steps forward.<br><br>After deliberate research my current thoughts are that we need to organize with our communities to support each other and create a generous love culture.<br><br>How I think of it:<br><br>1. Take inventory of the situation. <br>PAY ATTENTION to the wellbeing internally (mental, physical, emotional) and externally(food, shelter, family, friends, community). Check in at least daily or better yet try every breath and every moment.<br><br>2. Figure out what is lacking and TAKE ACTION. <br>Reach out for help and support (friends, family, community and government) - early, clearly and firmly.<br><br>3. Establish the relationships that will support you and GIVE anything that doesn‚Äôt serve you back - find someone to CARE for. <br>Share generously and lovingly.<br><br>4. SPEND TIME helping others and understanding how they are affected. <br>Share knowledge, resources, care. <br>Grow food and give it away. <br>Make art and share it. <br>Teach others your skills (online or in person when possible). Spread a message of strength, solidarity and encouragement.<br>BUILD value in the community. <br>Share freely as much as possible.<br><br>I hope we will put in the work together to explore gratitude, generosity and curiosity towards truth, love, awareness, action, tolerance, patience and (more) ACTION.<br><br>Which of the above steps deserve attention right now? Let me know how i can help ü§©<br><br>With love ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
