<p>The waves are coming my friends... Waves of harsh truths... Harsh and hard in the loving way... The way nature loves you... Not personal.</p><p>Well I see so many sufferring... can you accept why?</p><p>We need some new ways to communicate... back to basics... things got a little too wierd.</p><p>I propose a signal... </p><blockquote>For those of us willing to defend our personal rights and freedoms. Our own. AND to accept responsibility to tolerate and respect the rights and freedoms of others. With love.</blockquote><p>I propose a vertical line... to start with.</p>
<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card">

</figure><p>Place one vertical line however prominantly you can afford yourself. On those materials, actions, and procedures that limit your rights and freedoms.</p><p>Let us come to see that these vertical lines unite us on the question of standing up for ourselves. Speaking up. To take charge of our own rights and freedoms.</p><p>This symbol will allow us to gain strength... when we can look around and see that we have others standing with us.</p>
