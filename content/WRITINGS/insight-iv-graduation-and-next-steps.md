<p>Reflecting on <a href="https://seminariosinsight.com/website/seminarios-insight-iv/" rel="noreferrer">Insight IV</a> - 29 days of personal development, focused routines, presentations, sharing, exercises, collaborations, and exploration. I feel very grateful for this investment into my self, happiness and expansion. Now, I'm looking to share my gifts of creativity, problems solving, introspection, and coaching with more people,</p><p>I am deeply moved as I write this post, reflecting on the profound journey I shared with the incredible group during the Insight IV personal development seminar. The focus on heart connection, as inspired by the teachings of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e17zD9gSNPQ" rel="noreferrer">John-Roger</a> and the <a href="https://seminariosinsight.com/website/" rel="noreferrer">Insight Seminars</a>, has gifted me with an abundance of tools and experiences that I hold dear to my heart.</p><p><strong>Gifts Received</strong></p><p>I have been blessed with numerous gifts throughout this retreat. The sense of safety I now feel in any situation is a testament to the transformative power of our collective journey. I find myself flowing more smoothly through life than ever before, embracing each moment with laughter and joy, both with myself and with those around me. The retreat has reinforced my love for myself and for everyone I encounter, reminding me of the boundless nature of love.</p><p><strong>Everyday as a Game / Mission / Quest</strong></p><p>This retreat has also illuminated the idea that every day can be a quest, rich with opportunities for growth and discovery. I have learned the importance of remaining vigilant against complacency and comfort that can sneak in, allowing the ego voice to take over and lead to procrastination and avoidance. By staying committed to my practices—meditation, movement, and keeping my <a href="https://adikeo.notion.site/GTD-1b8bf27ed5394479b87d49ad24797d95" rel="noreferrer">GTD</a> (Getting Things Done) dashboard in check—I am determined to maintain the clarity and direction that this retreat has inspired.</p><p><strong>Honoring Our Shared Experience</strong></p><p>I want to honor the incredible ways in which each of you has enriched my experience. Witnessing the courage with which you confronted your limitations and released long-held limiting beliefs has been profoundly inspiring. The openness with which you connected with your gifts and shared them so freely has created a ripple effect of growth and transformation that I am grateful to be a part of.</p><p><strong>Sharing My Tools and Creations</strong></p><p>As part of my ongoing journey, I would like to share some of the tools that have supported me in managing my writing, ideas, and GTD flow. I have found <a href="https://adikeo.notion.site/GTD-1b8bf27ed5394479b87d49ad24797d95" rel="noreferrer">Notion</a> and <a href="https://obsidian.md/" rel="noreferrer">Obsidian</a> to be invaluable in organizing my thoughts and projects, and I hope they can be of benefit to you as well. Additionally, I am incredibly proud of creating the book cover for Silvia, and I would be delighted to collaborate on any other artistic endeavors that come up.</p><p>I also take great pride in the work we did together to set up a plan for Andrea's nurse staffing agency and clarifying the most valuable next steps. It was a privilege to this project and dream. Moreover, I have redesigned <a href="__GHOST_URL__/" rel="noreferrer">my personal website</a>, where I will be sharing my travel adventures and the steps I am taking towards creating my dream job and lifestyle. I invite you all to join me on this journey and to stay connected through the stories and experiences I will be sharing there.</p><p><strong>Gratitude and Intention</strong></p><p>Finally, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the assistants and facilitators who guided us with such wisdom and compassion. Your support has been invaluable, and I am inspired by your dedication. As a gesture of my gratitude and commitment to our shared vision, I would like to set a clear intention to volunteer in the upcoming Insight Seminars. I am eager to give back and to support others in their journey towards self-discovery and heart connection.</p>
