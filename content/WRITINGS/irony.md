<p>Why am I so tired?<br>Because I am scared to wake up<br>I donâ€™t know if I can,<br>so I go back to sleep,</p><p>I tell this to myself<br>As I sink back into the only place<br>I no longer exist.</p><p>With Time, I learned<br>Time does not stop when eyelids fall,<br>And the world goes black.<br>The detached state of manufactured sleep is not sleep at all</p><p>I can only heal when i let my full self know.<br>Face the pain, <br>Answer the question<br>Because deep down, <br>I know I know why<br>I am <br>So tired.</p>
