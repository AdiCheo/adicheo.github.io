<p>The fear of Canadian winter settles down now<br>I’m in a tropical coastal lagoon town<br>The strange contrast, urban productivity in lagoon heaven.<br>City life comes with a promise that you might travel anywhere,<br>For sure you'll want to... escape<br>Escape the grey boxes, glass and concrete that they built for you<br>Escape to sleep outside.<br>Escape to the mosquitos and the dogs.<br>Escape with the uncivilized.<br>...The outlaws that have been here for a while already<br>I would have ended up exiled if I stayed in the manicured world anyway.<br>So who’s really civil anywhere?</p>
