<p>It's clear to me that I'm in the cocoon...</p><p>Some transformation is happening under this shell... the protective skin of my personality</p><p>They seem not to notice... or they want to play it cool</p><p>My new colours - this new ability to fly</p><p>I shine from deep within</p><p></p><p>I know the revolution is coming... a new world with old beauty</p><p>The ancients will join us in the celebration of light</p><p>We will feast on generosity</p><p>Drink intoxicating love</p><p>Dance around the flames of joy</p><p></p><p>You gonna come to the party?</p>
