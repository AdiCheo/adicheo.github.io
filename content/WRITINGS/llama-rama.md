<p>Inspiration came to break me<br>I cared </p><p>Like all things<br>She will go<br>As she came</p><p>For now I take the gifts<br>And cherish the lessons<br>Formed by pressure and fire<br>That keep us apart</p><p>Would the whole world explode?<br>If we could come together<br>The darkness of collective passion will ignite<br>Only the flow of compassion can extinguish that thirst<br>And sighs of chaos will resound through the abyss</p><p>I find myself waiting when the page is written Â for the next visit</p>
