<p>Ha! <br>I can catch death lurking<br>Following me through some scarcely lit streets<br>In dark waves crashing<br>But not into me</p><p>I’m ready to die<br>To face the abyss<br>Meet a god<br>Or replay my list<br>Whatever you prepare<br>Some ceremony<br>To say farewell<br>Make my peace<br>Join the conscious eternity<br>Or burn away for all these sins</p><p>Well show your face<br>Why do you think<br>you need to surprise me?<br>I’m not waiting<br>I’m just ready<br>Is there anything else i need to see?<br>I’ve already been as big as i’ll be</p><p>Well i’m not in a rush either<br>I don’t need to go early<br>Some might even pretend to miss me<br>Or tell some story<br>They knew me and something<br>They never ask<br>How my shadow follows<br>Death looking around a corner<br>Waiting to for the moment<br>To dance with me</p><p>At least this time when we meet<br>I hope you don’t just disappear<br>Stay with me at least a bit<br>To get a rhythm and feel the beat<br>Eternal truth shines<br>Transparently</p><p>Rest easy my friend</p>
