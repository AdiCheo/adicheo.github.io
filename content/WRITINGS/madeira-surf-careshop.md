<p>I decided to start a project to build a wooden standup board by hand following an online course from David Weber.</p><p>I will update my progress on this page so feel welcome to bookmark and follow along as the adventure evolves.</p><p>I invite anyone with a strong will to join me at my studio and build their own surfboard or standup shoulder to shoulder.</p><p>I am currently organizing all the content and getting my tool and material list ready. Anyone that has info on the best place to gather some of Â these items in Puerto Escondido, kindly let me know &lt;3</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/E0E529E8-26AA-4FB5-9F3C-E1812E229DDF.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="320" height="293"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/1E631C5F-A9FB-4129-A1A1-8E721FC26A3A.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="267" height="320"></figure>
