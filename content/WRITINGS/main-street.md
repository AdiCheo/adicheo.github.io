<p>The sun beats me down<br>in la punta today</p><p>waking up, trying to leave the gravity of my hotel king, <br>and failing, back down<br>once i get out to get some cash,<br>i feel the weight of the immoral orgasms that kept me horizontal<br>heavy sun Sunday</p><p>and I can’t make my mind up...<br>where to eat, who to eat with, who to eat out<br>the questions of daily life in paradise...<br>overwhelming,<br>as heavy as a murder on the main street</p><p>do i even need to worry about survival in this wonderland?<br>maybe I’ll be just fine...<br>i think the nourishment of love will eventually satisfy my bodily hunger</p><p>a paleta (popsicle) cools the tongue of a dragon<br>in these parts old men are like the lost mythological creatures</p><p>Morality evade them too</p>
