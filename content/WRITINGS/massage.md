To him, health is a key to freedom and a better life. With his extensive background in martial arts, sports, and various therapies, Adrian has honed his skills in massage and healing to help others find balance and liberation from pain.</span></p><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Adrian's passion for wellness began at a young age, as he learned massage techniques from his father's energetic Reiki healing and his grandmother's deep tissue style. As he grew up, Adrian's involvement in sports and martial arts led to various challenges for his body, including injuries and pains. But he never gave up. Adrian continued to seek out the best therapeutic modalities, including massage, physiotherapy, chiropractic, yoga, meditation, and sound healing, to help his body recover and perform at its best.</span></p><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Inspired by the gifted healers in his life, Adrian decided to become a healer himself and took a course in Osteopathic Massage. He found that movement, massage, and other natural healing modalities were essential in balancing the mind and body, and elevating the human experience.</span></p><p><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Today, Adrian focuses on deepening his expertise in working with the body through movement, massage, and other healing modalities. He offers 90-minute healing massage experiences in Puerto Escondido (Rinconada), combining energetic, relaxing, and deep tissue techniques to enable healing at every layer of human expression.</span></p></div>

I also earned my first Gold medals in BJJ at a local tournament in Mexico at the Blue belt level.</p><p>Aside from martial arts, I‚Äôve loved to play a variety of sports throughout my life, from volleyball to soccer, contact football to weightlifting, and basketball among others.</p><p>My involvement in so many different activities, with my 6‚Äô7 height and lean build led to a variety of challenges for my body. Injuries, pains, and limits that I had to face early in my life and continually heal and strengthen.</p><h2 id="massage">Massage</h2><p>Between fights, competitions, training, and coaching I was always involved with therapies that ranged from physio, massage, chiro, reiki, yoga, gymnastics, meditation, cold therapy, and sound healing to help my body recover.</p><p>In my search for the best therapeutic modalities I found that movement is essential for my wellbeing. Alongside good coaching in the movement practice I benefit greatly from having trusted massage workers that have a strong connection with me.</p><p>I have always been interested in massage since I was little. In my familiy it was common that we massaged each other. Between my father's energetic Reiki healing techniques and my grandmothers almost masochistic deep tissue style I learned intuitively different methods to move energy and clear stagnant, blocked, or calcified tissue.</p><p>I didn't really consider massage as a professional offering until a close friend of mine sincerely pushed me to do it. After taking my first Osteopathic Massage course I started to practice with friends and family. Friends that had experience with many different massage, chiropractors, and energy healers were quick to say I had a special healing ability in my hands and a capacity to create relaxation and healing for them.</p><p>From that point on I decided that I will use my talent in healing as an offering for my community.</p><h2 id="healing">Healing </h2><p>My current focus is to deepen my expertise in working with the body through experiments using movement, massage, and other natural healing modalities.</p><blockquote>To me it all relates back to freedom. Freedom to use the body. Freedom to express, to compete, to live. And freedom to enjoy life without pain.</blockquote><p>To achieve this kind of healthy state the body and mind both need to be balanced, relaxed, and flowing with life. For this reason I think massage and movement are essential parts that open the mind up and allow it to find balance. The mind-body connection creates a cycle, which when it is healthy leads to higher vibrations in the body that elevates the human experience.</p><p>This is what I'm really after. Health as a way of increasing our capacity for freedom.  Health that opens opportunities in life. Better health that relates directly with better living.</p><div class="kg-card kg-callout-card kg-callout-card-green"><div class="kg-callout-emoji">üí°</div><div class="kg-callout-text">Contact me about my offer of <b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;">healing massage</strong></b> experiences in Puerto Escondido (Rinconada).
