- Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) for camp signups (Target: Reduce from 
    
    ```
    100+to<100+to<
    ```
    
    50, ideally <$30)
    
- Conversion Rate of LP (Visitors to Clicks to next step)
    
- Conversion Rate of Registration Form (Started to Completed)
    
- Number of Camp Signups per week/month
    
- Number of leads captured via email signup
    
- Time spent by Fleur on manual registration/receipt tasks (qualitative or estimated reduction)

2025-05-14
I think I remember, yeah, I think part of the issue is that you can't really track it when you do it this way.

And you're losing people, like, right off the bat, you're giving, you know, people that maybe they're just, like, kind of interested, you know.

And then they have already, like, three locations, so they have a decision to make, but it's not clear.

I don't think it's really obvious, even from those images, you know.

Like, if it's on the phone, for example, like, they're going to be just kind of scrolling through.

I don't know if it's going to give them enough, yeah, like, they're going to, you know, they're going to click through.

Plus, you have the March break camp there, so it's another, like, it adds the confusion.

You want to make it as clear as possible?

No, Adrian, there's a distinct landing page.

I see it.

I see it, but there's a button.

When you scroll down, you have the three maps.

Here, let me send it to you.

So you have the three maps, and then you have each map has two buttons.

So there's already nine options there.

Okay, hang on.

I'm scrolling down.

Yeah.

Okay, I see what you mean now.

You see?

So I'm just typing messages to summarize.

So basically, the landing page is already giving three locations.

And then multiply by three buttons.

And it's not even clear that the map is a button.

So there's nine options there.

And I'm just writing not clear.

Okay.

Okay.

So that was the first, I mean, that's the first kind of bottleneck.

Like, someone clicks your ad, they scroll through.

They don't have a clear, like, call now or sign up now thing.

And then they just go back and they just go to the next one.

You know what I mean?

Yeah.

So you're going to lose a lot of people right there with that landing page.

Before we even get to, like, the ad itself.

I don't understand how it's difficult.

Because it says, Magnitude Kids, Sunfield Summer Camp.

And then it gives you, you know, the details.

It tells you how long it is, the dates and times, the fees, daily Taekwondo.

Like, it gives you everything that we do.

And then why choose magnitude.

And then it says, choose your location below to register.

So I know what you mean, but I don't know how that's complicated on my end.

Okay.

Maybe I'm not using the right words.

So it's not, yeah, let's not say complicated.

It's not optimal.

It's not optimized.

So the idea is that you're paying to get people to this page.

Okay.

And you want them to achieve a certain goal.

You want them to either call you or fill out a form.

We want them to register.

We don't even want them to call us.

Well, right.

But to get them to register, that's the question you're going to ask.

What does a total stranger who just saw the ad on Google, what do they need to, you know, basically just like whip out their credit card and send at least $400 your way and their kid?

Yeah.

Right.

Right.

Right.

So the idea is that you have to win that, that trust.

To me, to me, the page is, the landing page is okay.

I don't think it, you know, I mean, I think one, that the information could be, let's see, I didn't really check the phone version.

Well, we didn't want to give them too much info.

No, you didn't want.

No, no, you want less.

Yeah.

You want, you definitely want less info and you want a much clearer action that they can take right on that page before they start clicking all kinds of things.

Because the thing is, look, if they, if they do click on one of the maps, I click on Ridgeway.

It takes me to a page that again, it doesn't tell me anything.

I have at the top March break open book of free martial arts class.

And now I have a bunch of options.

It's not, it's not anymore the summer camp.

If I click on that.

Okay.

I see that.

That's hang on for a second, Adrian.

Yeah.

Okay.

I see.

I see what you mean there.

Let me just see here.

Yeah.

So it's taking them just to our homepage of the each location.

So that's a problem.

Yeah.

If, if, if they click on summer camp then, let's say, um, and now they're on the summer camp page, but now it's, it's like repeating the information you already gave them.

Yeah.

And they got to search this whole page.

Scroll all the way down to register.

So like if they wanted to register, you're making them do three things before they can even find the registration.

And then once they click it, now they got weeks one to nine.

Yeah.

They got to click it.

Then they got to add it to cart.

And then this is really confusing too.

Like how many children?

One, two, three.

I know, I know that's for the discounts.

Like I know why it's like this.

And then you have quantity.

So you have one child, two, three children and quantity.

So they're like, wait, what, what am I doing?

You know why?

Because, um, we weren't able to, uh, get rid of that quantity button.

Because it's Squarespace.

Right.

So I don't know.

And it's Squarespace.

They don't have technical support, Adrian.

Yeah.

It's all, it used to be by chat, but now they even took the chat away.

So when, and then the issue too, is that in order to register, we, we need a lot of their personal information for health reasons and stuff.

So I think, yeah, there's, I don't know.

I know what you mean now.

Yeah.

And then, and then so look, so now I'm adding to cart.

So I gotta, I gotta go to one.

I gotta go to another, add to cart.

And then I gotta find the cart button because, and this is what I'm really curious to on mobile.

You're laughing.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm laughing because you're, you're, you're making yourself pretty clear right now.

So there's a lot of, um, yeah.

You know, like, I mean, I mean, we know this from before, but yeah, the question is, is how to make it.

So, so now they've done all that work.

They've added the weeks and they go check out.

And then I'm putting my email in there.

Let's see.

Um, Adi.

Okay.

Okay.

Now I have, now I have the form.

Now I have the long form.

And then you got to fill out a pretty long, intense, uh, health questionnaire.

Yeah.

So what I'm saying is I, I, yeah, I mean, I think you want them to, you know, I mean, it really depends if it's, I don't think it's that important for you to one, get all this information up front.

You want them to sign up.

You know what I mean?

Like you want full camps, right?

So full camps, full afterschool, full, all the things.

Yeah.

So you, and you don't even care, you know, as a gym, like you don't care if, you know, like if they pay and they don't come, like that's, that's on them.

Right.

So you don't need them to.

Sorry, Adrian.

Just give me one second.

Yeah.

Hi.

Just give me a second.

I'm just going to go to the office, Adrian here.

Okay.

Wait for it.

There's the cleaning cloth.

Maybe you can show George where it goes and everything.

Yeah.

Thanks.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay, Adrian.

I'm here.

All right.

So now I'm, I'm just looking at how many things are on this form just so we have a number.

Okay.

So.

Okay.

So you have.

Email is one.

Then you have. by first, last name, phone, address.

Oh yeah.

There's lots of things there, Adrian.

So when you kind of go through it, you'll see, you know, a lot of, a lot of things that are taking an extra couple of steps.

Um, so then I guess once we decide on how to, um, streamline that, uh, what's the next course of action?

Do we need to hire a Squarespace specialist or do you think you can figure it out?

Because I don't think you've ever used Squarespace before, right?

Uh, I mean, yeah, I'm, I'm tempted to just say, like, redesign it with, with, with something better.

You know, I could do, I could do like, but the thing is, you have to be open to the changes, right?

So what I, what I've been looking at, you know, with the AI as well as, is redesigning some of this stuff.

Okay.

Um, you know, the, the changes mean like, the main thing for me is, is having, you know, the, you can have the, the homepage that leads to all three.

That's fine.

Where you guys contribute, um, together to that, to the ads and everything for that.

Yeah.

Um, but you should have your own ads money for each location.

Cause.

No, that doesn't work, man.

No.

Doesn't work.

No.

Okay.

Tell me, tell me what's wrong with that.

Because you, you'll have someone living right by Ridgeway that, that goes to work at kitty mat and they want to bring their kid close to work or vice versa.

Or you'll have a kid, uh, living somewhere and they, um, want to, even though they're not living close to either or working there, you know, they, they want to drive 20 minutes because they, they just like that location.

Or it's on their way to drop off their kid at a childcare center.

There's so many different things.

And then I don't want to be stuck paying advertising fees for Mike's location.

Duane.

And he benefits.

And then I don't.

Or vice versa.

I get.

Okay.

So look, all right.

Right now you're spending a hundred dollars, 110 per, um, person per new signup.

Yeah.

So, so right now, like, I mean, I don't, I don't know yet what performance we can get, you know, but I'm, I'm pretty sure we can do better than that.

And, and, and the idea is that if you can get it down to, let's say 20.

Yeah.

You know, of course.

Yeah.

That would be, that would be, that would be perfect.

But we're not splitting location money because honestly, it's, you know, how difficult it is to work with my brother-in-law too.

You know, you know this.

That's why, that's why we did what we did because remember back in the day, um, I don't know if he ever helped us with the website at one point in time, but we all shared the same website.

Yeah.

So he would always complain that, okay, we're getting, oh, Adrian's helping Duane more than Mike.

And, you know, you know, the magnitude Ridgeway is getting more business because, so, you know, in order just to stop that, we all have our own location and we all equally share the advertising.

And then it also just builds the brand better as well.

So everyone knows, okay, if I need to do anything for magnitude, they go magnitudewall.com and then they pick and choose the location that we're looking, what they're looking at.

So for me, um, you know, a hundred percent, we all locations now have their own website.

It's all the same pretty much like it's a little different, a little unique each one, but for every service that we do, we have a advertising landing page.

So if it's martial arts, we all share the same landing page.

Same thing with, uh, after school, same thing with birthday parties, almost like, you know, McDonald's or long goes, right?

You go to that central website.

And then from there, you funnel down to the individual location and then, and then that's the way it goes.

Okay.

So if, so honestly, I don't think that's probably going to be a hard no.

I do appreciate a lot of your ideas like that you're saying right now.

And I think it's, you know, the, the signup, it definitely has to be way more streamlined.

I a hundred percent agree with you with all of that.

Just let's just keep the landing page.

Um, you know, we could even change the landing page.

So it's more fluid and, you know, it's more exciting and whatnot, but, you know, as far as doing their own advertising dollars, no, that's not going to a hundred percent.

That won't work.

Okay.

So, okay.

Let me, let me take another approach.

Um, because I want you to think about your outcome.

I want to get a very clear outcome.

So are you mopping?

Sorry, sorry.

Where are you mopping?

Oh, okay.

You're going through that way.

Sorry, Adrian.

Yeah.

Okay.

Sorry, Adrian.

Yeah.

Okay.

Sorry.

Okay.

Okay.

So take it back.

What were you saying again?

Okay.

Um, well, I think, uh, the landing pages, it's a, it's a great idea that you have them separate.

Um, I think you, we, we have to, um, I mean, all these things, you just got to test and see what works.

Okay.

So what I'm saying is that if you, uh, if you, uh, if you run a test, even with a hundred or $200, uh, dollars as a budget for ads.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay. uh if you run a test even with i don't know 100 or 200 uh dollars as a budget for ads okay on a specific page okay that has um yeah that has a very clear form a very clear sign up you know and and if you want to separate it like because i see that there's you know these kind of notices like please make sure you're choosing the correct location um yeah i'm just trying to think how to make it make it very streamlined it's you know it's it's like well i guess there's certain things with camp that we really need to know about the kid like you know do they have allergies um you know we want to know that before they even pay with a credit card are they special needs are they whatever whatever like these are all things that we have to know because heaven forbid we you know have a full camp and then we have a special needs kid come in and you know we don't have the staff to kind of deal with it we're you know it's a freaking nightmare as you know you've been to camp before with us you know you know the nightmare that that that entails right so so i would say adrian honestly i think part part of it is the sign up it's really hard there's multiple multiple pages that a customer has to fill out i know that's that's a huge issue um and um um that's number one and i and i guess number two maybe it should be you know like i guess i'll i'll let i'll let you kind of i don't know maybe we can check a couple other camps that are really big and see their how they sign up people um there's a company called pedal heads i mean they're nothing compared to us all they do is teach kids how to ride a bike pedal heads pedal heads pedal heads pedal heads okay i'm gonna share it with you yeah i found it here pedal heads yeah okay yeah it's pretty easy so you'll see that they have um multiple locations you know they have like a ton and then so look when you go to pedal heads the first thing it pops up like don't miss on all things pedal heads and then it's a sign up with email and phone number and and their location so province so so from there they they already you know so okay i'm trying to give you kind of an idea of how some of these leads work with other companies obviously they're gonna have someone on staff that can deal with with leads coming in and actually following up right but most of them will have at least emails that go out and say hey this is what we have going on um you know this month so come sign up to summer camp sign up to this sign up to that um here they're collecting the phone number too so it's possible that for example if you if you're in a crunch uh and you want to fill up some numbers you actually pay uh you hire like some callers that they basically have a script and they they call into these people that have gone to your website put in their number you know so they want to be contacted it's not like a random person and you're basically calling them and saying hey this week we have a special offer we're doing the summer camp with 20 or 30 bucks off yeah we never do that we never do special things or anything never right but yeah i'm just giving i'm just kind of giving kind of uh an idea of like why they're collecting this information yeah before before so you're collecting information before you get them to um send you know basically pull out their credit card uh so that's that's one part and then and then so here what i see that they're kind of doing good you know they also have this separation because they have different programs yeah so summer bike camps swim lessons trail riding and soccer camps all right let's see learn more and if i want to summer camping classes okay and now i have um the programs activity location yeah you see they're gonna have a similar so what they have here is a map for the location which is the normal google map um i think that's a good that's probably a good option too is to to do the google map rather than the kind of like the the draw the drawings that you guys have that's what the guy that that we hired to redesign the site he actually did that but then at the last minute he like not the last minute so he did like a mock uh website yeah and then he goes okay right after march break we're gonna we're gonna launch this new website and he goes this is way easier to read blah blah blah and it made sense it was formatted differently than what it is but fleur didn't really like the feel of it it didn't for her it didn't feel like magnitude but i said okay you know what just just give me the the website and then you know we can kind of plug in a page at a time like redo a page and then up you know upload it and and whatnot so um yeah so but when he he did the home page it had it had it had the map it didn't have like a cartoon map it actually had like a real google map where you can actually click on the map and it can show like a precise location and then you can open it up like through uh google maps and it can take you right to the location where you know our map is just a cute map showing where we were located right yeah yeah there's a lot of things like that so but do you think i mean are you open to changing the website are you open to changing the maps or you're gonna have pushback from florida i think if it i think if it's slow changes um that's that's fine but you know we i don't know how much that's gonna affect us um with signups like if we start changing things does that does that mean that a website goes right back down to zero and no one sees us or or is that just a myth i mean right now i mean right now that i mean the bottom line is the ads are not bringing you people um the uh how many people do you have signed up so far that are from it's a little slow this year that's why i'm kind of panicking last year it was a lot we never really changed anything from last year to this year so maybe you know obviously money's more tight for families we got that i understand that but you know the parents that are working and everything they do need a camp so you know what we do for the kids and for the price it's amazing right because obviously you know we're really hands-on that's why our price can be so competitive and so affordable so that's you know i know we have a great product i know you know for many years we've been really busy i just don't want to miss the opportunity of you know missing out and you know what you're also saying too is you know we're spending so much money for leads and we're not really getting any benefits from it that's a concern right so i guess we have to fix it sooner than later right so my question to you is if there's slight changes to be made on the website with the maps and whatnot maybe i don't know maybe i can share my screen with you and we can maybe do it together uh or uh i don't know whether i don't know i don't know really kind of what to do here so the other thing that i can propose is that we do we just do like a a separate website um just for kind of like you have the summer camp okay the landing page but yeah i'm just trying to think but not with squarespace like something totally different and we just make a very simple call to action sign up and um and just run one of like create a new ad that just goes to to that you know and just see if it performs better so the but the performance we're gonna have a bit of a challenge testing like you know because so look right now you have time so you can get people to sign up it's like think of it like early bird like you have time for people to sign up and in the meantime figure out if they have allergies or special needs um you know if it's like if it's like one day before camp i get that you don't want them to sign up without giving you that information right but i'm gonna get a lot of pushback bro on that from flirt because even from on pedal heads and i register it's gonna ask me all these questions anyways i mean you let's see let's see how they sign up even if they have an easy form or easy version i know i'm gonna get huge pushback from flirt 100% she will not go for that so i'm i'm thinking right away let's let uh i don't know i'm thinking let's maybe make it easier for people to sign up i'm all for that adrian but i don't think i want to open up a new website to you know to do that i think i think that's kind of counterproductive to be honest with you okay okay let me let me see how what their registration look like okay let's see here so they have so they have a youtube video to show you how to register no god see so it shouldn't be it shouldn't be that hard right so if they have a youtube video on a register you know it's not easy right but but that's the thing i mean with you guys if you're not going to change it then you better make a youtube video to explain how to do it you know what i mean like it's i'm okay streamlining it like you said i'm okay um you know updating the map uh you give me suggestions on what you think to make the uh the landing page a little more appealing you give me suggestions on how to make the the um the home page not the home page but uh let's just maybe let's just work together and we compromise i i'm i'm okay with that because i know the sign up could be a lot easier to be honest with you adrian and on honestly like fleur's not a um you know obviously she's not a uh a website developer and and you know you know so that's you know i think if we hired a person to make it you know cut not cut corners but make it a lot more user friendly i think definitely that would be way easier if you know what i mean but for us to have a new website um you know like i know that's gonna be a hard no not only for fleur but also for mike as well because he's the one that really pushed the squarespace website and and and whatnot okay so i'm just looking at their sign up okay good maybe maybe there could be you know how we're asking a lot of questions and whatnot would it be easier for it to be like a google form instead of on the website sign up or like i don't know google uh google google form uh well i mean that's what i'm saying but i'm just i'm just i'm just asking i mean my my main question is is uh yeah why block like you like you don't want to block the people from from um from registering first like let them register and then what i think we can do is um yeah basically in the registration say hey this is this is like uh part one of the registration part you know like your child is not registered until you complete the you know the documentation process and then you send them um all the questions and all the all the things so they can do it at their own time like i don't think that's gonna work man you think they're not you think they're not gonna do it and just show up is what you're saying yeah yeah yeah so so i think yeah because but the thing is look the people that would uh yeah i guess the people one the people that would do that are i guess are just not gonna sign up one um and and then and then and then you have you know just the normal people that have their attention is just not taking them through that whole process they're also not um signing up i guess i guess okay what i'm trying to get to is breaking down this this problem into into like smaller actionable steps so the first thing i want is um i want some information from the customer i want either an email address or a phone number so that if they landed on the page you have some way to reach out to them and be like hey are you interested in summer camp or whatever um and that can be automated too so that's that's the other thing is if they give you an email that can be an automated email that goes out um you know like 10 minutes after they sign up or or the next day and then every month after that you can reach out to them and say hey are you still looking for this or that yeah yeah i think there should be a call to action or like what you said to enter um maybe we could we could definitely implement that i definitely think that we should sharpen up that landing page to be a little more um a little more user friendly and then so those are two things i think we could do kind of right away as soon as possible and i think i think when we're registering for camp at magnitude it's there's a lot of double questions because you know well if you if you try to register a kid at magnitude for summer camp obviously you know right before you actually have to pay then obviously don't but you know time to see how long it takes for you it takes a long time and there's multiple questions that are asked more than once so i think you know a hundred percent it could be streamlined a lot better adrian besides that yeah so yeah i'm definitely thinking you know right off the bat we can implement those changes like you know immediately okay so how how do we how do we go about doing that do we make another landing page do we do we use do we use because you know for your customers you're not they're not going to see i mean you know you're going to forward it to it's an ad right so like my customers so that's the reason why we have two separate ones right because you'll have the landing page the advertising landing page that connects all three locations into one marketing campaign so there's some information there but then you also have people oh yeah you know what i did a birthday party at magnitude ridgeway let me let me tie oh they do they do summer camp oh let me find out about summer camp i noticed that they have buses there or this or that and then so they're there so we have actually two forms of you know people entering our camp we have the ones that we're reaching out to with the ad and then we also have our internal customers that go on our website they know where we are they maybe they don't see the summer camp ad and then they register that way so that's why we have kind of like a double double ad you know what i mean double the information i don't know we're very unique like our business it's it's you don't understand how many people would you know drive on the highway they see the rainbow bus and they're like oh shit that looks cool magnitude kids or whatever and then you know they're at home and then they you know they google magnitude kids they don't they won't see the ads that we're spending money on google because it doesn't say magnitude at all in our ad because that's what google said it said not to use magnitude name just go summer camp kids sports blah blah blah and then then our ad will show up but if you type in magnitude our ad will never show up so they're like oh shit okay this is magnitude oh five minutes away from my home okay let me click this location boom it takes you oh i'm interested in summer camp i click that and then bank that's it you you land on that on that second page which is the same page that you connect to after the ad as well right right right right right yeah so i i know what you're saying but it's it's it's so unique our business and like but i know the ad is not doing well you know what i mean so you know i have these stupid people from india from from uh google in india that set up this ad but i don't know it's not it's not really going well and then frick i hired this guy then i find out he's from nigeria and man he's got access to everything and i'm like panicking still so so what what what was the deal with this guy for example what was your um i mean what what was uh the package well he just he no he just had an ad um in this fiber whatever he's like oh we're gonna help you run a google ad to be you know really good and you know you're gonna maximize your your clicks and customers and a smart campaign you know the way that they do it differently than the average person and so the whole thing was about 300 bucks for him to run my two ads and then you know the price is fine because you know for you know doing an ad like that i figured that that'd be okay and then that's it and then that's how i connected with him and then that's but and he he wasn't gonna set up a landing page or anything like that for that that price no just the ad no he all he was gonna do is the ad with the information that i gave him okay i think my my i don't want to cloud you or anything adrian but my from my feeling and and whatnot if we tighten up the advertising landing page and we tighten up the the the um the summer camp page for each location and we tighten up the registration so it's not so long i think i think we'll definitely see an improvement and and you know without having to make a brand new website or whatever whatever square space is pretty easy too i can even give you um you know through credentials you can copy you can copy a page adrian and then and then so let's say you want to copy our landing page you can copy it and then you can play around with it and you can change it and you know you could do different things and then you go hey duane do you like this and then you say yes or no and then all we have to do is switch it right make that page live and and just get rid of the other page yeah yeah so i mean we can do that it's gonna be yeah it's just i mean there's a lot of like different little projects here you know so it's i'm just trying to think like how to you know how to help you like well number one is money i think i think the number one most important thing for me right now is making sure that my summer camp is full because this year i i feel it's way different financially speaking for a lot of people so i know if i kind of stay status quo with what we've done before i don't think honestly in my heart heart of hearts i don't think that's gonna that's not gonna happen it's not gonna be successful this year if i do that okay so i think i think for now like you know maybe we should you know like although the automated emails and everything is super important for me i think um maybe this would take more precedence if you know what i mean yeah of course i mean this is money bottom line yeah coming in yeah um so the question is what what's what's your kind of outlook right now if you if you kind of just keep keep going at it the way you you've been going at it what what what kind of signups are you expecting i don't know maybe i'm wrong and maybe we'll be full full like always but maybe maybe not i have no idea adrian i have no no no idea whatsoever but one thing i know for sure is sign up for camp is very difficult there's a lot of steps and and you're right we're not capturing a lot of people are landing on our website we don't have like all you know sign up for a newsletter or sign up for you know blah blah blah write down your email you know like we don't have any of that at all and you know i i've heard feedback from people that have seen our website uh saying that you we should be capturing all that information a lot better which we haven't been okay but i don't know i don't know if we should do that too because does that make us look more like a money grab like all we're thinking about is capturing your information to solicit you for the for the rest of your life or should we kind of run it like a school like because yeah yeah but the thing the thing with that doing is yeah the soliciting is they're putting that information they can x out of it and not give it to you or once you send them an email they can unsubscribe hello hello hello hey man hey man i'm sorry for that that was my fault um i understand what you're saying now you're saying that well you know if they're putting their information you're not really trying to entrap them or anything right that's what you're trying to say right and they can unsubscribe so i mean if if their kids grow older and they're still getting messages about summer camp they can hit unsubscribe and and they're gone right yeah so so you don't have to worry about that you know like if they're giving you their email it's because they want reminders about what you do okay um so so that's okay so that's yeah i mean that's that's my take on that it's uh you know some people actually want emails i'm not one of those people like i prefer to just like when i want something i i go to it you know but um but yeah but yeah there's a lot of people that they still use email like that they they want you know and and uh they want those reminders okay um so anyway that's just one thing to yeah that's one thing to look at for squarespace to enable the you know like something like that to collect the emails um yeah i'm just i'm just kind of thinking like what would you know make it for me um like a success you know because for me it's it's a thing is like if i'm yeah the way i see it is it if we just kind of like i mean if if you can get to your goals and get a full camp i'm all for it but the the worst case for me is that you spend like a bunch of money on ads a bunch of that money on changing just like a couple things on the website that are not gonna are not the the issue the main issue and then you know and then it's it's just like oh it kind of works you know it it's it's not it's not a project that that then i'm i'm fascinated about because it's like okay well you know i i see the potential for this to be you know kind of like a game changer for your business both in how much time you spend managing it yeah you know because it's all connected i mean i don't know if you had a chance to open my my little mind map there but you know the website connects you to your customers through email through signups and then how you interact with them through the same through emails and phone to get to get the information and to yes move them to the goals that you're looking for right whether it's you know i mean you just got to get them to do do the things you know and and um say listen you're you're you're a hundred percent right you should see the amount of work that fleur has to do by hand for summer camp because when people fill out all the forms she's got to manually put it into sheets google sheets or do do receipts it's like she's working so hard and i know i told her i go listen there's a way that all of this can be done you know like just with the computer doing that for you and she's like i don't know how i don't know how to do that and you know that starts getting her really overwhelmed and stuff right so yeah listen i a hundred a hundred percent agree with you um with everything that you said i mean there's no there's no pushback on that it's just you know you know things like you know changing the whole website you know we're definitely going to be getting like pushback if you kind of move it from squarespace to another platform or you know i think she'd be okay with the internal upgrades like making it more ai efficient and everything and i know squarespace is you can definitely do that because the guy that was setting up this website before he bailed on me he was able to really do a lot of things like uh you know automatically as well so which we found really cool but that and i don't know what happened i think he's a bit mental or something he kind of just uh you know ghosted ghosted us at the end like whatever oh yeah the guy is strange man but and so i'm i'm i'm for it i think i think um i don't know i don't know what to maybe you can think on it adrian i i mean what do you what are you kind of thinking because i know you're you're really computer savvy do you think you could you can learn squarespace i think it's all the same concept right and they even have ai integration now with squarespace yeah i mean i i can learn you know it's not that's not the issue the issue is is it going to get you to your goal you know that that's what i'm looking at it's it's my our goal is to be as hands-off as possible and let the computer or the ai do a lot of this you know registration make i think might be a lot of this you know let the computer or the AI do a lot of this, you know, registration make.

I think my goal would be, obviously, to make registration a lot easier for our customers.

The input that the customers give us to be automatically uploaded so that the staff knows exactly what they need to know, including summer camp receipts.

And that takes a lot of time for Fleur, too, because she's got to go into Perfect Mind, create a customer, and then input how many weeks a customer does camp.

And then at the end of the summer camp, then have the summer camp's receipt saved so when the parents ask, hey, I need a receipt, Fleur right away has it all ready, and she just hits the button and it sends it to them.

Yeah, yeah, we can automate all of that.

I mean, you know, you just got to, yeah.

And that will really save a lot of this.

She's working, like, 40, 50 hours a week just doing that nonsense, right?

Anyways, buddy, I got to go teach.

Okay.

I'm teaching again.

So I guess the next thing I'll do maybe is when I get home, I'll make you a contributor to Squarespace so that you can see.

I thought I did that already, actually.

Did I?

I don't think so, no.

Oh, okay.

Yeah, have a look.

I have the perfect mind.

Okay, yeah, that's right.

Perfect mind.

Okay.

Got it.

Okay.

Okay.

All right.

I'm going to work on creating a bit of a proposal and figuring out what, you know, what I can do to actually, actually help you.

Yeah.

Okay.

Well, what I'm going to do as well, I'm going to give you some people that run Summer Champs.

So I gave you Pedal Hub.

There's also another company called Oakville Academy of the Arts.

They, they're not as big as us, but maybe you could see how they register people.

Yeah.

Maybe even the YMCA or, you know, maybe that's, that's, you know, obviously that's a way cheaper camp, but maybe you see how they register kids and how much information they ask for, because obviously, you know, they're, they're, they've got tens of thousands of, of kids.

Sure.

You know, we have hundreds, they have thousands, right?

So they're doing it somehow too.

So maybe if we can kind of mimic the way that they sign up people, that that would make it easier for us as well.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

Let's have a look.

Okay.

Obviously timing is, is an issue because you know, our, the signups are really hurting right now.

So we need to kind of figure this out.

So I really want to get to numbers.

Duane, like when you say they're hurting, I want you to tell me like they should be, you know, I need this many kids and we're this many kids.

Okay.

So once you text me that.

Yeah.

And then I'm going to ask for, okay.

And then I'll, I'll message you back.

Okay.

Sounds good.

Okay.

Okay.

Talk soon.

Thanks for sure.

Thanks.

Bye.

Bye.

Bye.

Let's Let's
