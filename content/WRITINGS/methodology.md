<blockquote>As a well-spent day brings happy sleep, so a life well spent brings happy death. - Leonardo Da Vinci</blockquote><p>Joy isn't fought for, it's made. To us, spiritual enrichment is a science. We don't believe in luck, fate or magic — only cause &amp; effect. Our method focuses on experiences with measurable sensations, not mysticism. We follow data and impact, not perceptions.</p><h2 id="we-do-experiential-learning">We do experiential learning</h2><p>The popular opinion around discovering our purpose is broken, so we looked back to ancient wisdom. Instead of treating spirituality as a secretly mysterious process protected by institutions and dogma, we treat it as an experiential game of life that thrives in collaboration and validation (like science).</p><h3 id="institutions-and-dogma-old-"><strong>Institutions and Dogma (old)</strong></h3><p>Most spiritual practices require a subscription to an institution, labels, and faith in some quantity of dogma that resembles a mysterious key to connecting to universal Truth. The student consumes untestable information and then is expected to follow some rules in the real world regardless of consequences.</p><h3 id="experiential-development-new-"><strong>Experiential Development (new)</strong></h3><p>ADICHEO uses ancient wisdom in a ecosystem that resembles the collaborative process of social dynamics. We provide a community of seekers, tangible methods, wisdom resources, real world missions and feedback so you can break out of the bonds of modern society and achieve the state of overflowing with love and generosity.</p><h2 id="how-our-method-works"><strong>How our method works</strong></h2><p>Traditional spiritual systems produce a hierarchy of followers with no discernment or uniqueness. We provide seekers with a diverse community and empowering resources — then we let inspiration ignite.</p><h3 id="next">Next</h3><ul><li>Back to <a href="courses">Learning Overview</a></li><li>Start with <a href="practical-freedom">Practical Freedom</a></li></ul>
