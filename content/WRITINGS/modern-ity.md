<p>It occurred to me that modern development discards me.</p><p>When I came to this paradise I passed through a portal into an old world…<br>A dimension of simplicity and dirt…<br>Slowly it transforms according to the plans of the modern imbecile…<br>Starting to resemble the developed web of concrete boxes I thought I left behind…</p><p>Maybe this is not the most advanced that we have been on this planet?</p><p>I (it) might be the most regressed actually…<br>Imbalanced… and weak…<br>To depend on artificial sources of power… energy… nutrition…<br>To consent to polluted mental and spiritual energy…<br>To disconnect meaning from the #language of Nature… Power… Truth…<br>To confuse the symbols on the path to bliss…<br>To fear the gifts of joy, freedom, and love…</p><p>Lovers want to be punished…<br>Captors want to be loved…</p><p>A thief collecting the souls of cherished friends wants to be worshipped…<br>The angels blessing my bread and wine are scorned….</p><p>You sit looking awkwardly…<br>At a future that may not return.</p>
