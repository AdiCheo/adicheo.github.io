<p>This is a document where Iâ€™ll reflect on my life. Like a journal or a diary - but I hope to capture my thinking and consciousness so I can overcome my mental obstacles. </p><p>I hope that if I write out my thoughts it will expose my ego and my negative patterns so that I can defeat them. </p><p>I will add to this document in a non-linear or organized way. </p><p>The goal is to document the things in my life I feel are important and comment on my mindset and feelings towards those events.</p>
