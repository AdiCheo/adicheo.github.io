<p>I can't say i know - but i feel the, most important thing is the sense of purpose. There is nothing more.<br>The sense that anything you do is important, that it has an effect on the world.<br>Anything you do can make you feel like you are adding to your purpose, or that you're taking away from it.<br>If everything you do is to add to your purpose, you'll feel good about your life. If you do things because you were taught to do them, or you're following a trend, or just for the sake of it, you probably wont feel good about your life.<br>So if you use this to guide yourself, you are automatically on the right path, and you can't go wrong, there is no way.<br>On this topic, books you can read about the meaning of life: <br>The Alchemist<br>Tuesdays With Morrie</p><p>I didn't want to expand on it, because it's something you have to find out for yourself. If you want an example, just go through a day with this in mind.<br>How do you feel?<br>That's it.</p>
