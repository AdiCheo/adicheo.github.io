<blockquote>"Nobody is more inferior than those who insist on being equal." ~ Friedrich Nietzsche</blockquote><p>The problem with feminism is <strong>equality</strong></p><p>equality, for what? equality with men? with white men? For what? </p><p>the lie is that the patriarchy is white men, <br>and they are so much better off than everyone else. <br>The reality is they are slaves. <br>they are trapped. </p><p>White men have different privileges in the prison of the commercial economic system. <br>Different privileges.<br>Equality of privileges?<br>It's not something worth fighting for. <br>This is just the prison mentality, <br>trying to climb to the top of the slave hierarchy. </p><p>equality is a sham.</p><p><strong>Freedom</strong> is worth fighting for. Love is worth dying for.<br>Personal sovereignty to be your own ruler to make decisions for your body, your mind and your life.<br>We should all have an equal opportunity to pursue personal power.<br>We should all be educated to fight for self governance.</p>
