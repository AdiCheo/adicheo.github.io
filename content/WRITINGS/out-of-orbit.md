<p>This next escape seems to hold a different kind of weight...<br>Like I'm changing the destination of the title Home<br>When I reflect deeper I notice that Canada never quite felt Home-like<br>It lacked a welcoming warmth, it lacked cultural value, it lacked real interest for individual thinking</p><p>I notice that this move is a push to escape the orbit around my family and their house in Canada<br>It's an invitation for them to change their patterns<br>To escape the routines of submission they have integrated so well<br>To dream bigger, better and out of the comfort of the well-known</p><p>This change is heavier than the goodbyes, farewells, see you laters..<br>It requires a shedding of skin<br>It asks me to forget the masks I'm so used to wearing here<br>The polite smiles under judging eyes</p><p>I accept that I don't know "better"<br>Not in the way of presumably knowing the future...<br>Or being able to compare</p><p>I know the feeling of freedom, the open road, the lack of a precise destination<br>I know the smell of adventure, fresh, exhilarating, curious<br>The sounds of joy too, the rhythmic exclamations between contentful silence</p><p>It's all quite different than what I see now...<br>So many people saying... Well what can we do anyway?<br>The silence is tense and doesn't last long... the air is filled with empty chatter<br>Threats about every human activity<br>Threats about your future income... your duties to the state<br>Some weak reassurence... Oh it will get this bad everywhere... there's no escaping it</p><p>Oh well... Maybe there is no real solution...<br>The demons will catch up you say... sure...<br>Well I can at least enjoy the run...<br>I can at least try to fly.<br>Out of this orbit</p>
