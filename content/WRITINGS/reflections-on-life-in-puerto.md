<p>
I have some reflections to cover since you've seen me.</p><p>How familiar I've become with this place. <br>And how entrenched. <br>And how many things I've picked up that even to go on short trips I feel like I have to keep a place here for storage, or leave things in the care of others.</p><p>The main difference is how accustomed I've become to the beauty of sunsets, beaches, mountains or landscapes full of palm trees and wilderness, landscapes of mangroves or lakes, rivers, hikes that took me over waterfalls and rock cliffs. And just the sheer variety of vegetation. </p><p>Just going on a short moto ride I see horses, cows, donkeys, chickens running wild, dogs of every kind. People are living very close to nature here. And the wild, is very accessible. Requiring you to join in. </p><p>Join in the savagery and to blend in with it. Oh, crocodiles. Everywhere... jellyfish manta rays. Turtles! Fucking thousands of sea turtles laying their eggs on the beach and poking their heads out when I go paddle out on the ocean. </p><p>The waves. Body surfing or trying to surf on a foam board that I got passed down. Yeah, there's no way for me to leave. At least not yet. </p><p>I haven't even told you about the intensity of the psychedelic trips that I've done. And, and the worlds that they took me to... totally different worlds than what I've experienced so far. Insights of things I never imagined existed. Total mind fucks.</p>
