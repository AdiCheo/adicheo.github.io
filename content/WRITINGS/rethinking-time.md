<p>When I first started building the <a href="https://conti.newom.one">Life Calendar app</a>, I thought I was just making another productivity tool. Little did I know I was stepping into one of humanity's oldest challenges: how do we represent and relate to time?</p>
<p>As <a href="https://rupertshepherd.info/documentation/the-problem-with-dates">Rupert Shepherd points out</a>, even something as seemingly simple as recording dates becomes complex when you consider different calendar systems. The Julian calendar, Gregorian calendar, lunar calendars, and various cultural new year celebrations all represent valid ways of marking time.</p>
<h2 id="beyond-linear-time">Beyond Linear Time</h2>
<p>Most digital calendars force us into a linear, grid-based view of time. But is this really how we experience it? In many cultures, time is understood as cyclical - an eternal dance of seasons, lunar phases, and natural rhythms.</p>
<p>This realization led me to ask: What if we could build an interface that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embraces multiple ways of seeing time</li>
<li>Allows for different cultural interpretations</li>
<li>Connects us to natural cycles</li>
<li>Makes space for personal meaning</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-circle-as-interface">The Circle as Interface</h2>
<p>The circular calendar interface emerged as an answer to these questions. By arranging time in concentric circles, we can:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Layer Multiple Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Solar months</li>
<li>Lunar cycles</li>
<li>Cultural festivals</li>
<li>Personal markers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Show Relationships</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cycles within cycles</li>
<li>Patterns across time</li>
<li>Connections between events</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Create Personal Meaning</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Custom layers for goals</li>
<li>Space for reflection</li>
<li>Visual representation of life patterns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-decolonial-approach">A Decolonial Approach</h2>
<p>This project aligns with what <a href="https://decolonizingtime.wordpress.com/time-lab/">Decolonizing Time</a> describes as "opening up the possibilities for organizing our days." By creating an interface that accommodates multiple time systems, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenge the dominance of any single calendar system</li>
<li>Make space for diverse cultural perspectives</li>
<li>Allow users to find their own temporal rhythm</li>
<li>Connect personal time to natural cycles</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="technical-challenges">Technical Challenges</h2>
<p>Building this flexibility into a digital interface presents interesting technical challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Structure</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How to store dates across different systems</li>
<li>Managing conversions between calendars</li>
<li>Handling cultural variations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Visual Design</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Creating intuitive circular navigation</li>
<li>Showing multiple layers clearly</li>
<li>Maintaining performance with complex visualizations</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>User Experience</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Making complexity accessible</li>
<li>Balancing flexibility with usability</li>
<li>Creating meaningful interactions</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>
<p>This is more than a calendar app - it's an exploration of how technology can help us relate to time in more meaningful ways. The circular interface is just the beginning.</p>
<p>We're starting with basic functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple event tracking</li>
<li>Personal reminders</li>
<li>Basic customization</li>
</ul>
<p>But the vision is larger:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple calendar systems</li>
<li>Cultural event integration</li>
<li>Natural cycle visualization</li>
<li>Personal meaning-making tools</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="join-the-journey">Join the Journey</h2>
<p>If you're interested in exploring different ways of relating to time, or if you have perspectives to share from your own cultural background, I'd love to hear from you. This is a collaborative journey of rethinking our relationship with time.</p>
<p>Let's create something that helps us all find our rhythm in the endless dance of time.</p>
