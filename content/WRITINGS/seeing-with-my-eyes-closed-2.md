<p>Emerging from a personal development retreat (Insight III), I’ve found myself grounded in a deeper sense of peace, freedom, and trust. This artwork, <em>Seeing With My Eyes Closed</em>, reflects the journey of letting my heart take the lead—a quiet yet powerful guide in a world of shifting illusions.</p><p>Like a benevolent friend who knows me better than I know myself, my heart has shown me how to navigate life with clarity and compassion, even when the path isn’t visible. It reminds me that true vision doesn’t always require open eyes—it’s about feeling, trusting, and embracing the unseen with courage.</p><p>This piece is an invitation to pause, reflect, and perhaps explore what it means to trust your own inner compass in the face of uncertainty.</p><h2 id="guided-reflection-confidence-and-trusting-your-heart"><strong>Guided Reflection: Confidence and Trusting Your Heart</strong></h2><p><strong>You can record yourself saying this script and listen to it when you need it. You can also rewrite / translate it to better connect.</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Settle In:</strong></p><p>Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Feel the rise and fall of your chest. Let yourself arrive fully in this moment, leaving behind the rush of the day.</p><p>2. <strong>Visualize Your Heart:</strong></p><p>Imagine your heart as a glowing, steady light within you. It’s warm, radiant, and unshaken by external noise. This is your center, your truth.</p><p>3. <strong>Connect with Confidence:</strong></p><p>Picture this light growing stronger as you whisper to yourself:</p><p><em>“I trust my heart to guide me with clarity and compassion. I am confident in my ability to choose what serves my highest good.”</em></p><p>4. <strong>Release What Weighs You Down:</strong></p><p>Bring to mind a thought, attachment, or judgment that feels heavy. Imagine gently placing it in a flowing river. Watch as the current carries it away. Whisper:</p><p><em>“I let go of what no longer serves me or those around me. I am free.”</em></p><p>5. <strong>Choose Your Words with Care:</strong></p><p>Reflect on the words you speak to yourself and others. Let your heart guide the tone and intention behind them. Say to yourself:</p><p><em>“My words are powerful. I use them to uplift, connect, and create harmony.”</em></p><p>6. <strong>End with Gratitude:</strong></p><p>Place a hand over your heart. Feel its steady beat, a reminder of your resilience and inner strength. Whisper:</p><p><em>“Thank you, heart, for guiding me. I trust you. I am confident. I am free.”</em></p><p>When you’re ready, open your eyes, carry this energy forward, and trust the path your heart lights for you.</p>
