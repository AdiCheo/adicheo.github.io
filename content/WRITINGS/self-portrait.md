<p>I woke up feeling very energized on the 13th. </p><p>Even though I didn't sleep with the full moon I started working on this idea right out of bed.</p><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">Login for free to read the rest of the story &lt;3</blockquote><!--members-only--><p>When I had the finished first draft I looked at it and asked... If this was a poster - where I was promoting the gift of my genius - what would the text be?</p><p>Nothing Makes Sense came out first... a line from a yet unplished poem "puerto boy reflections"</p><p>Creativity Workshops came second - and then 1 on 1.</p><p>I filled in some other details and changed gears... and who would care about this?</p><p>Propbably no one... but I went on and wrote a whole sales copy introduction.</p><p>This message was written specifically for a Puerto Entrepreneur whatsapp group... the post immediately before was inviting woman to some kind of divine goddess meeting...</p><blockquote><strong>Tldr; Creativity Workshop 1:1 500p</strong><br><br>Hi friends, puerto preneurs, divine goddesses 👆, hustlers, buskers, cat lovers, artists, haters, and lost amigos. I had a ⚡️spark of inspiration this morning… made a 🖼 painting and then turned it into a 🌅 poster.<br><br>Introducing to you guys FIRST time ever for feedback and (hopefully) joy + love … an invitation to book 1:1 Creativity (destructivity) Workshops with me 🚀🤗🤩😵‍💫🧠😶‍🌫️🤯<br><br>Workshops will be 1 hour sessions at a café/beach/ private location by Your invitation.<br><br>The focus will be to pulverize through all mental blocks, shadow obstacles or chakra barriers and unleash the creative tsunami from the depths of your soul.<br><br>Sessions can include talking, writing, drawing, debating, crying, moving, dancing, body work, reading, getting distracted, praying, running, eating, coffee, laughing, esoteric shit, and even fighting 🥊<br><br>This is NOT therapy and probably you will need therapy after if you’re not grounded, decided, and ready for an electric change.<br><br>Those of you that know me the years that I’ve been here as some of my labels… Adrian, big jesus, an outlaw, a conspiracy theorist, a poet, a trying comedian, a lover, a fighter…you may not know that in my past life I had a real career solving problems as a computer scientist for biotech companies, I worked on a bunch of failed and not-so-failed tech startups, all while running an undefeated 7 fight amateur MMA record, international gold medals in Taekwondo, and doing the whole digital nomad thing before everyone got forced to do it.<br><br>Hopefully that’s enough to peak your interest or scare you away…either is probably for the best… so enough about me… tell me… what could be possible if you get a little crazy?<br><br>Pricing the sessions at 500p …with some kind of package deal eventually …but if you invite me this week with the recognition of what you’re looking for to be my first partners to dive into the unconscious cosmos then the first 5 sessions are 50% off.<br><br>Please DM me how this post made you feel 🙏🤗 whether you love it, hate it, think I should jump off a cliff, or have some guidance on how i could do my pricing I would appreciate it all 🤩 and I already agree if you say it’s way too long 🤷‍♂️<br><br>Thanks, Adi</blockquote><p>It made me realize a few things...</p><ol><li>I want to be recognized.
