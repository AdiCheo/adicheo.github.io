<p>Sometimes i feel like I've said everything there is to say<br>Like from this point i can never get lost again<br>A combination of experience, knowledge, and love<br>That can raise me from every fall<br>That can wake me from the sleep of death</p><p>Again i find I'm lost and hurting<br>That I'm blind to the light of love<br>The magic shines despite my lack of attention<br>And i trudge through muddy waters again<br>How is it that the darkness seems infinite and the light so (thin) shallow?</p><p>I see my friends here... grasping for something that floats<br>I see us dancing in the intoxicating dark<br>Drowning in pleasure and wasted effort<br>Are they in blissfulness?<br>Are they free to fly?<br>The flickering candles burn out or blow out</p><p>Well freedom is my mission...<br>or is it my trap?<br>The freedom to be light let’s me dip into the dark<br>Just why am I diving in so deep?<br>The scuba gear of diving in darkness is pleasure and comfort<br>without this gear i have to stay closer to the light<br>Where’s the freedom in that?</p>
