Adrian is one of these stellar, young men who shines. Adrian is a full on warrior, who is choosing to walk a conscious path whilst applying his great heart and care to those around him. It is my great and good fortune to be a recipient of Adrian‚Äôs wisdom and care. He looks out for me in these wilds of Mexico we live in. Feels good to know he‚Äôs around. When I share time with Adrian, I find myself in wonder asking myself,‚Äùwho here is the student? And, who is the teacher? He is often teaching me new maps of consciousness through his ways and studies. I love being around a human like Adrian who catalyzes my growth and development in new and deeper avenues. He‚Äôs the kind of human that inspires other humans to become better characters quite naturally by how he is and lives. Imagine my joy at being invited to receive his new offerings of body work and healing! I had a great 90 minute session with him a few weeks ago. He has the gift of connected, skilled, grounded touch that transmits safety with strong positive energy. I would highly recommend working with Adrian if you are serious about transforming your life, taking better care of yourself and becoming an authentic, healthy steward of our planet and our people. Be sure to expose yourself to Adrian‚Äôs growing understanding of Natural Law. This is worth the price of admission!<br>With Warmth and Gratitude,<br>Candice Dugan<br>Mexico. 2023</blockquote><hr><blockquote class="kg-blockquote-alt">Highly recommend Adrian's massages ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê<br>Ashley<br>Puerto Escondido, 2022</blockquote>
