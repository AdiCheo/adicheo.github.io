<p>The disease of suffocation<br>It came in with a punch, and suffocated a few<br>And slowly it suffocated all...<br>Their reason dried up, their minds oxidized, their jobs evaporated, their rights exhausted...<br>A suffocating disease... It grew a mucus of fear on our breathing organs, and expressed itself in our stead<br>Only those who could sweat it out, overcome the pain inside, avoid anti inflammatory medication,<br>...They navigate to the new world<br>A new world ordered from the lifeless weight watching you, pressuring you, with fines and detainment<br>A new hierarchy of vaccine stamp status, QR tattoos, some of us have seen the signs of the future...<br>all the politicians fled too early to somewhere tropical..<br>They were publicly shamed for making the most reasonable decision..<br>To leave the country they fucked..<br>To somewhere less suffocating</p><p>Let me</p>
