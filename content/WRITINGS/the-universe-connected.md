<p><br>Did you ever wonder<br>If everything is Connected,<br>If the universe is a symphony of<br>violins - expanding and contracting.<br>Strings breaking and healing,<br>like a muscle, or the roots of a tree.</p><p>The music of Strings,<br>The infinite possibilities,<br>An orchestra of collisions,<br>Music of mind and matter.</p><p>I sit and wonder,<br>I pause - for a moment, I can feel.<br>We are here to Listen,<br>We are here to Choose,<br>We are one of the universe, Connected.</p><p></p><p>We know our past,<br>We know our future, what was and will be,<br>And now, together we go, wherever we are,<br>Spiraling through Space.</p>
