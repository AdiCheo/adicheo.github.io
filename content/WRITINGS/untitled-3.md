<p>Thinking to write a little "guide to finding your dream Puerto apartment" since this seems to be a recurring thing to the community in Puerto.</p><p>Start by researching what's available on facebook marketplace and groups, mercado libre, airbnb, hostelworld</p><p>Ask around what people are doing for living accommodation at the desired timeframe you're looking for</p><p>Make your list of must-have amenities so you can easily communicate it with any landlord or person that asks.</p><p>Walk around your preferred neighborhood collect and text any advertised WhatsApp numbers that are posted on gates and windows.</p>
