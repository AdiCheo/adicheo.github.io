<p>As I continue to work towards publishing a novel. I decided to create some narrative content to mix in with the poems and images that I'm working with.</p><p>Consider supporting me with this project by sharing it with someone who would enjoy it.</p><p>A draft chapter about my return to Romania and some of my meditations during my visit...</p><hr><p>As I sat upon the damp earth of the Carpathian foothills, breathing in the crisp mountain air, I felt myself transported back to a time long past. The scent of rich soil and ripening fruit evoked memories of my childhood in Romania, a land where the old ways still held sway against the relentless march of progress. But this wasn't just a simple reminiscence; it was a visceral experience, as if the very ground beneath me was speaking directly to my bones.</p><p>Consider this: We are all products of our environment, shaped by the landscapes that birthed us. The Carpathians weren't just mountains; they were the ancient guardians of stories, whispered through the rustling leaves and echoed in the babbling brooks. Each breath I took seemed to fill me with more than just air – it was as if I was inhaling the collective memory of generations past.</p><p>The earth beneath my palms was cool and slightly gritty, a tactile reminder of the impermanence of all things. How many hands had touched this soil before mine? How many lives had been lived and lost on these very slopes? The weight of history pressed down on me, not oppressive, but grounding.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/WhatsApp-Image-2024-11-03-at-14.18.37.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1258" height="1112" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/WhatsApp-Image-2024-11-03-at-14.18.37.jpeg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w1000/2024/11/WhatsApp-Image-2024-11-03-at-14.18.37.jpeg 1000w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/WhatsApp-Image-2024-11-03-at-14.18.37.jpeg 1258w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In that moment, I realized that we often mistake comfort for happiness. The modern world, with all its conveniences, had lulled us into a false sense of security. But here, amidst the wild beauty of the Carpathians, I felt truly alive. Every sense was heightened – the earthy aroma of decaying leaves, the distant cry of a bird of prey, the play of sunlight through the canopy above.</p><p>I closed my eyes, allowing the sensations to wash over me. In my mind's eye, I saw flashes of my grandmother's weathered hands, gnarled like the roots of an ancient tree, yet strong and sure as she kneaded dough or tended her garden. I heard the lilting cadence of her voice, telling stories of forest spirits and brave heroes, tales that seemed fantastical in the light of day but took on a haunting reality in the depths of night.</p><p>The Carpathians held secrets, I knew. Secrets of survival, of resilience, of a connection to the land that modern society had all but forgotten. As I sat there, I felt a stirring in my chest, a call to action that I couldn't ignore. It was as if the mountains themselves were challenging me: "What will you do with this knowledge? How will you honor the legacy of those who came before?"</p><p>I opened my eyes, blinking against the sudden intrusion of sunlight. The world seemed sharper now, more vibrant. I realized that this journey back to my roots wasn't just about nostalgia – it was about rediscovering a part of myself that had been buried under years of urban living and digital distraction.</p><p>As I stood, brushing off my clothes, I made a silent vow. I would carry this experience with me, let it inform my actions and choices. The whispers of the Carpathians had awakened something primal within me, a connection to the earth and to my ancestors that I couldn't – wouldn't – ignore.</p><p>The path ahead was unclear, but I knew one thing for certain: I would never again take for granted the wisdom of the land or the stories it held. The Carpathians had spoken, and I was finally ready to listen.</p><p>I closed my eyes and began to meditate, employing the Vipassana techniques I had honed over many years. My breath slowed, and I focused intently on each sensation arising in my body. As my awareness sharpened, the magical atmosphere of my grandmother's garden unfolded before me with startling clarity. It was a place where reality and fantasy intertwined in a tapestry of wonder that few in our modern world could comprehend, now perceived with the heightened senses cultivated through years of disciplined practice.</p><p>As my mind settled, I saw once more the loving face of my grandmother, Angela. Her eyes sparkled with the wisdom of ages, a stark contrast to the vacant stares I had grown accustomed to in the bustling cities of the West. She spoke of țărani and tigani, the peasants and gipsies, royalty and commoners spanning Ardeal and Oltenia, the true children of our land, who understood the whispers of the wind and the secrets of the soil. The whole of Romania was but a village, a single village in the great forest of history, each generation but a heartbeat in the heart of the earth.</p><p>"Listen, my child," she would say, her voice as rough and beautiful as the Carpathian landscape itself. "The land speaks, if only you have ears to hear it."</p><p>In those days, I had dismissed her words as the fanciful notions of an old woman. But now, as I sat amidst the very earth that had nurtured her, I wondered if there wasn't some profound truth hidden in her teachings.</p><p>The meditation shifted, and I found myself transported to the lively gatherings of the farmers and herders, their homes nestled in the rolling hills of Ardeal or the sun-drenched plains of Oltenia. Their folk music, wild and free, seemed to capture the very essence of life that so many in our modern world had forgotten. How different they were from the people I encountered in my travels through Europe and America - people who lived in gleaming towers of glass and steel, yet seemed disconnected from the very ground beneath their feet.</p><p>As I slowly opened my eyes, I felt a renewed sense of purpose. The whispers of the Carpathians had always been calling me home, urging me to remember the wisdom of my ancestors. In a world racing towards an uncertain future, perhaps it was time to look back, to reconnect with the earth and the ancient knowledge it held.</p><p>With a heavy heart, I thought of the forests being felled, the rivers being polluted, all in the name of progress. How long could humanity continue on this path before the very earth itself rebelled?</p><p>I stood up, brushing the soil from my clothes. I had a story to tell, a message to share with a world that had grown deaf to the whispers of nature. It would not be an easy task, but then, nothing worthwhile ever is.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/IMG_6450-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1000" height="1331" srcset="__GHOST_URL__/content/images/size/w600/2024/11/IMG_6450-1.jpg 600w, __GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/11/IMG_6450-1.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>As I began my descent from the mountains, I carried with me the magic of my memories and the wisdom of the țărani. In the distance, I could hear the faint strains of a doină, playing a melody as old as the mountains themselves. And for a moment, just a moment, I allowed myself to hope that it wasn't too late for humanity to remember its roots and find its way back home.</p>
