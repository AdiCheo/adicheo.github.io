<p>You crossed the line<br>Intimidating me with letters on paper<br>Claiming my work<br>Claiming my life</p><p>You never made anything<br>You never gave any thing<br>How can i be so stupid to feed a parasite like you</p><p>Employing weapons of mass delusion<br>Controlling centers of confusion<br>Printing papers of unpaid deaths</p><p>Can I loan 1000 dead hands<br>Can i loan 100 dead heads<br>Can i loan 10 future kids<br>Can i borrow 1 million minds</p><p>How many souls do you have in the bank?<br>Blood flows well through your gold<br>Drains the market on your hands<br>Kills the judgement of educated men</p>
