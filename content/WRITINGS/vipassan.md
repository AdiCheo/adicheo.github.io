<p>Recently, I came across some tools and lessons that have helped me connect with peace, harmony and happiness in my life.</p><p>By sharing these realization I hope to enable others to experience the same changes.</p><p>The steps are as follows:</p><ol><li><strong><strong>Morality</strong></strong><br>Establish a firm base in virtuous behavior avoiding harmful/useless behavior</li><li><strong><strong>Awareness</strong></strong><br>Learn to master your mind to perceive the world at the deepest level and as-it-is</li><li><strong><strong>Wisdom</strong></strong><br>Use your mind to develop wisdom of the true nature of the world to make better choices</li></ol><p>The truth required to develop wisdom is all around us. We have to make the effort to open up to the truth; to witness it and understand it. Having misunderstanding about the reality that is all around us is the primary cause of our stress and suffering.</p><p>This is the beginning of learning to live a happier, more harmonious life.</p><p>Welcome!</p>
